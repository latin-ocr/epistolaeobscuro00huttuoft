IN TRODUCTION

I warded off the stroke by a legal process, and made
my appeal to the Apostolic See. His Holiness there-
upon remitted the case to the Bishop of Speyer for
consideration, and forbade any other person whatso-
ever to take any steps with reference to the Oculum
Speculare, under pain of excommunication. Upon
the duly appointed Judge opening the proceedings,
the Dominicans sent their proctor, but not in legal
form—thus acting in contempt of the court—and strove
by dilatory devices to prejudice my cause. Further-
more, while the suit was yet undetermined, and not-
withstanding the Pope's inhibition, they took upon
themselves to commit the said book to the flames, at
Cologne. Nevertheless the Apostolic J udge hath, with
the aid and counsel of J unsts and Τ heologians‚ formed
and issued his judgment, the tenor whereof Ι now send
you by reason of the kindly interest that you ever feel
in all those who have the love of learning and letters at
heart. If, a twelvemonth back, I—-a poor dwelle1 in
the far· off Hercynian Forest-——was maligned before my
English fiiends, let me now by your support be rein-

The decision of the youthful Bishop of Speyer—-or
rather of the assessors whom he appointed—was wholly
in Reuchlin's favour. The Augenspzegel was held not
to be a heretical book; Hoogstraten had therefore
slandered Reuchlin, and must be mulcted in costs

The fury of the Dominicals may be imagined.
Hoogstraten‚ they decided, must promptly appeal to
Rome, and at the Curia he should be backed by all the
influence, and much of the wealth—-of the Mendicantsl
If they could not win their suit, they had good reasons
for believing that they could protract it till Reuchlin
was ruined--or dead, and then, as “Lyra Buntschuh-
macher” in his enthusliasm put* it, “they would
effectually damn hi1n!’'

In the summer of 1514 the main action of the
drama is, accordingly, transferred to Rome. Leo X.
had for more than a yea1 occupied St. Peters chair.
