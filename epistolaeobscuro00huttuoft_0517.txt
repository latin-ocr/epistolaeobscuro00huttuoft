proffigsffiuaesunday take some consecrated salt, and with

it make the sign of the cross upon the tongue, and eat

it, as saith the Scripture, ‘⁶ Vos estis sal terrae‚'’ which 5
is by interpretation, “Eat ye the salt of the earth.'' ῑ

Afterwards make the sign of the cross upon the breast‚
and again on the back3 in like manner put some salt in
each ear, not omitting the sign of the cross‚ and taking
heed that none fall out. Finally recite the following
devout prayer :—
“Jesu Christe Domine,

And Evangels four, do ye

Fend me from ev'ry harlot's harm,

And from the soreeress’s charm—

Lest she my blood shall suck, and wring

My paps with anguish : I will bring

If ye preserve me, as oblation‚

A pretty asperge for lustration.'’

And thus you will be delivered. And if the blood-
suckers come again and gorge, they will fall sick

themselves,

And, now, how standeth it with Doctor Rem-blm?
The Magisters here say that he is too much for you;
but I cannot believe that he can overcome Magister-
nosterS. All the more do Ι wonder that you do not
write somewhat against him.

Fare ye well, more than etei-nally. Greet for me
Herr Johmm Pfefferkorn and his wife: tell them that
Ι wish them more good nights than the minutes that
the astronomers reckon.
