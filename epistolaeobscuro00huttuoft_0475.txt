([ MA GISTER CONRAD OF Z JV I CKAU
sencletle greetz'ng to Magister Ortzcin Gratius·

NASMUCH as you have written to apprize me of
all things concerning your mistress—how dearly
you dote upon her, and how she cherisheth you, and
sendeth you posies and kerchiefs and girdles and the
like, and taketh no guerdon from you, as is the
wont of venal hussies-— and how, when her spouse
goeth abroad, you visit her to her great content—and
how you thrice embraced her in succession‚ and once
on the threshold behind the door, chanting “Attolife
portas ,ι’ ”—and how when her husband returned you
fled privily by way of the garden-I therefore will in
turn now relate how Ι have sared with my lady-love.
She is a topping dame, and a wealthy, and Ι scraped
acquaintance with her by a strange chance, for a certain
gentleman-commoner, a friend of the Bishop’s, was our
go—between. Straightway I fell over head and ears in
love with her, till by day I knew not what I did, and at
night I could not sleep. But when Ι would have
slumbered I cried aloud from my bed, “Dorothea!
Dorothea! Dorotleea!” so that the students in the
hostel heard me, and ran to me, saying‚ “ Herr Magister,
what would you, that you thus cry aloud? If you
would fain make confession, we will fetch you a priest ’²
—for they thought I was at the point of death and
cried upon S. Dorotlzea with other saints. Thereupon
I was mightily abashed. Nevertheless when I visited
my beloved Ι was always so terrified that Ι durst not
regard her, but grew red from head to foot. Then
quoth she, “Prithee, Herr Magister, why so shy?”
Then I said that I was afeared to tell her. But she
must needs have an answer, and would not let me go
until I told her—she said, moreover, that she would not
be out with me, tho' my words were downright roguish-
11655. Then at last I grew bold and opened my heart
to her. Can you call to mind how that you explained
long ago, when you expounded Oz-id in his ‘⁶ Art of
