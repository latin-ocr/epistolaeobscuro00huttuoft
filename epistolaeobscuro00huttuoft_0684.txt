LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

from on high with sore blains, nor smite our vines and
our corn with hail and frost, so that the times of so
great famine in the world should cease? If, on the
other hand, ye do not believe these great benefits to
flow from the Mass, then are ye, by the Lord, suspect
of heresy; yea‚ ye are more assuredly heretics than
Ι V essalia and Doctor Rem·ltle')1.' '⁷

Lo, Reverend Magister Ursa-ite, Ι have thought it
well to tell you all this—that you may see how that all
men hold themselves on Rem-Meos.ae side against you.
By my conscience I believe the Devil himself favoureth
this Benclzlin„ and we are finely bemired. And now I
commerui myself to you.

From §perier—where strange scandals are spread
abroad concerning us; for 311 1116 Reuchlinists declare
that the Colognese are naught but raw 111103.
Nevertheless :—

Of pride in you I have a heap,
For you are patient as a sheep;

And all revilings you endure
Like simple priest in country cure.

yourself as though you 11616 6137,11.11113 1 commend
in 11011, for it suiteth well with 0116 who 113111 skill in
11111 rwful arts- —to 1111 how 10 conjure the (16111 11110 3
glass, or elsewhere—for such 316, almost without excep-
11011 ofttimes 61 ‘tay 11 13 111661 100 11131 311 311611 should
likewise be bastz rrds—and 11131 11011 wne one 11 33 told me
