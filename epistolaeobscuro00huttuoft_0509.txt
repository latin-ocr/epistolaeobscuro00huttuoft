used to say that the eircumcised are dearer to a woman's
heart than the uneireumeised3 wherefore she declareth
that when her husband dieth, and she taketh another
spouse, he must be one who hath been fitly trimmed.

These disputants are of the Theologieal Faculty,
and they allege for their part sundry weighty reasons,
one whereof is that were it not so, Jews who had become
Christians might be regarded as being yet Jews at the
last J udgment——their virile deficieney being made mani-
fest—and hence an injury would be done to them ; but
the Lord doth injury to no man.—Q.E.D.
