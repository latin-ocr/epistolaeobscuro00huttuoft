LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

And Ι have lately said mass with the brethren, “ De
Spiritu Soe7zeto,’' that God might give me his grace and
a good memory for syllogisms in disputing with these
fellows that only know L atinizing and how to com-
pose themes. And into that mass was foisted a collect
for Magister 110111 Ηο083ΐ1 atem, and Magister Α1 11οῖιί

11011 T 01180113 Regent of St. Lazwenee HosteL that
they may conduct to the 8031 of refutation a certain
Doctor of Laws hight Jolumm Ηο110111111, 3 36011131· poet
and an arrogant man withal, who putteth himself, in
opposition to four Universities‚ on the side of the 161113,
and frameth propositions most scandalous and offensive
to pious 631 3-33 «101101111 Pfqffer lcor 11 hath demonstr ated,
and Magister Α111οΖοἷ. And all the while he is not

groundeth himself, hath openly declared that Doctor

self dareth not give 3 decision adverse to 30 pious a
University, seeing that his Holiness is no theologian,
and doth not understand the‘ ⁶·Cont1a Gentiles” of the
blessed Thomas—albeit it is rumoured that he is Versed
in poetics. A Magister who is 3 priest at St. Martin’s
showed me a letter in which that University promiseth
in most friendly fashion real and earnest help to her
sister of Cologne. And yet these Latinists presume to
run counter to them.

A little while ago I sojourned at Mainz, at the sign
of “The Crown‚” where two braggarts annoyed me
greatly, calling the Doctors of Paris and Cologne idiots
and fools! And they said that the books written on
The Sentences were mere moonshine‚ and in like manner
they declared that the ‘⁶ Processus '’ and the ‘⁶ Copulata‚”
and the ‘⁶ Reparationes ” were all balderdash! There-
