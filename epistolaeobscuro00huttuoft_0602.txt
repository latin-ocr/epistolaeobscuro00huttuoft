The Reacc‘hlim'st objecim- 6’ὛΥ11050 declares that 116
supports the Churoh is a heretic: but -Johann Pfeffer-
korn declares that he supports the Church: ergo, he is
a heretio. The major premiss is manifest, since he who
boasteth that he supports the Churoh assumes that the
whole Church is in error, and that unless he supported
it, it would fall and be destroyed. Such an one would
also appear to be Anti—Pope, that is, desirous of being
Pope in opposition to that pope who has been chosen
by the Catholic Chureh. For to support the Church
is the duty of the Pope; but Pfefferkorn arrogates this
duty to himself—therefore he is Anti-Pope, and a
heretie who implies that the Pope erreth and is not
a good shepherd. The minor premiss is manifest from
the words of Johann Pfefl'erkorn, who alleges in the
aforesaid book that he is “a lowly member of the
Churoh.” Now in the body a lowly member is the foot,
because the feet stand on the ground, that is upon the
earth3 and if the feet were removed the body would
fall: ergO, l‘fefferkorn pretends that the Church stands
on 111111, and that he supports the Chureh.

J replgs, that Pfefferkorn does not use the words 111
such strictness, nor as in accordance with their primary
signification. hut he calls himself a member, that is
a part, of the Chureh, 111 the sense that every good
Christian man is a part of the Churoh—«or even a mem-
ber, to use the term in a wide meaning. ‘⁶ Lowly,'' too,
is to be taken as signifying devout and simple; as the
same Johann Pfefferkorn saith in his Epistle to the
Pope: “All unworthy though I be at thy most holy
feet, etc.'' Therefore it must not be inferred that
Pfefferkorn speaketh against the Pope.
