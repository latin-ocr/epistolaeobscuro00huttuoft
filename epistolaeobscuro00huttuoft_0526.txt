LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

you before I make an end. If you have a son,
or other kinsman—or a dear friend of yours hath
one—who is destined to be a student, send him
hither to me at Leipsie. We have many learned
doctors amongst us, and rare good victuals in our
hostels—seven. courses twice every day, at noon
and evening; the first is called Ever—that is,
porridge3 the second, Almam—that is, Soup3 the
third, Daily—that is, greens; the fourth, Agaz‘n
(md again—that is, meat 3 the fifth, Sometimes—that
is, roast3 the sixth, IVever——that is, cheese3 the
seventh, Now and then—that is, apples and pears.
We have good liquor wsthal, called Conveniam.
Behold now, and see! Is not this enough? We
keep this order throughout the year, to the great
content of all. Nevertheless in our chambers we
keep not overmuch victuals to eat between whiles‚
for this would not be healthfuL and would hinder
the students in their work; wherefore I have sent
round to all the scholars these verses :—

“ Within these walls let all observe
The standing regulations:
Be sure that he who sups with me
Provides his proper rations.''

You perceive that I too am a poet.—-But enough,
lest I should prove long-winded. Written at
Leipsz‘c, hastily, beneath the blue sky; and may
you fare more joyfully than a bee among the
thyme‚ or a fish in the waveS. Once again,
farewell.

See now, Herr Magister Orth‘n, if this letter
pleaseth you, and Ι will send you a whole book full
of the like; and right excellent they are, according to
my poor judgment. I have naught else to write
to yfqgrewelh in Him who created all things.

Dated from EBERBURG, where I would that you were with me. Δ
Friday‚ between Easter and Pentecost. ’
