1. 12] HILDEBRAND MAMMACEUS

the thing without Ι had seen a letter from one of the
Order of Preachers-a Magister—in which he related
the tidings in sore anguish. He wrote withal that the
Pope hath allowed the A‘ugenspiegel to be printed at
Court, and the booksellers to vend it, and every man to
read it! Thereupon Magister Hoogstraten made peti-
tion to leave Rome, and would fain plead poverty. But
the J udges would not let him go, declaring that he must
await the issue, and, moreover, that he eould not plead
poverty, seeing that he arrived at Rome with three
horses, and while at the Court had guests at his table,
and dispensed much money, and had bestowed many
gifts upon the Cardinals and Bishops and Assessors of the
Consistory—wherefore it was not possible for him to plead
destitution.

HQAEXAEQH! what are we to do next, if Theology is
thus insulted‚ so that a single Jurist is able to prevail
against all the Theologers? Ι verily fear me that the
Pope is no good Christian-for if he were a good Christian
it would be impossible for him not to uphold the Theo-
logers. If, moreover, the Pope pronouneeth judgment
against the Theologers‚ it seemeth to me that an appeal
to a Counoil might be made3 for a Council is above a
Pope, and, in a Couneil, Theology hath a preeedence over
the other faculties. And then I trust the Lord will
show his loving-kindness‚ and look upon his servants the
Theologers‚ and not permit their foes to triumph over
them, and will give us the grace of his holy spirit to
enable us to surpass the fallacies of these heretiCS.

A certain Jurist lately deelared that it hath been
prophesied that the Order of Preaclzers would perish,
and that out of that Order would proeeed grievous
offences against the Christian Faith--sueh as never were
heard of before. But grant that this may be far from
the truth ! For that Order is right profitable‚ and if it
were not for that Order I know not how Theology would
endure——for the Domsivnieaus are more deeply immersed
in Theology than the Blinorites or the Α regu-stimans, and
follow the way of the Holgs Doctor‚ who never erred.
They have, too, many saints of their Order, and are bold
in disputation against heretics.

Ι marvel how it eometh about that Magister Jalmb
