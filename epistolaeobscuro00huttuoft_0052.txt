INTRODUCTION

religious or philosophical views‚ we shall not be far
wrong if we say that his sojourn in Italy had made
him, in the literal sense of the word, a free-thinker—
but a free-thinker who felt no impulse to impose his
own faith, or want of faith, upon the world at large.
We need not be greatly surprised, therefore, to learn
that on returning to the Fatherland in 1503, Mutian
accepted, without hesitation, a canonry at Gotha.
Here, inscribing ‘⁶ Beata Tranquillitas⁷’ above his
study door, he resolved to spend the rest of his days
in learned leisure. Other preferments were proffered
the recluse from time to time, but were invariably
declined: his income sufficed to provide him with
books, and he sought for nothing beyond them.
Nevertheless, natural indolence, or a contempt for the
opinion of the world, led Mutian to seek no literary
renown. He has left no writings behind him, save his
letters,1 and, to judge from internal evidence, we may

Before long, however, the “blessed peace ” of
Gotha began to pall upon the gregarious Mutian.
Society there was doubtless as dull as it was limited‚
and a scholar who does not write must converse.
F ortunately his old university was scarce twenty miles
away, and Mutian began to betake himself thither,
often for considerable periods.

At Erfurt he' speedily made himself the centre of
a congenial circle. A band of young and ardent
humanists had thither congregated: their aspirations
were lofty but vague, and needed but the guidance of
a leader of riper years and experience to burst the last
bonds of scholastic tradition, and take their places in
the forefront of the army of light. The epigrammatist

brilliant but bibulous Eobanus HessuS‚ then in his
early youth—J ustus Jonas, the brothers Eberbach, and
Herebord von der Marthen, were all numbered among
the young disciples who from time to time sat round
Mutian’s easy-chair, and hung with mingled joy and
