IN TRODUGTION

stadt had for his pupils the all-accomplished Celtis;
Wimpheling, theologian³ scholar, and educationist;
Beatus Rhenanus3 Pirckheimer, whose rugged features
are familiar to us from Durer's famous portrait3 and
Bebelius: and, thirdly‚ Alexanderkfiegklus—prince of
eda o ues.

p I-flgeggius pelsonally had but slender claims to scholar·
ship—“ small Latin and less Greek'’ would seem not
unfairly to sum up his attainments—but it seems
evident that he had, like Richard Hooker‚ “a most
blessed and clear method of demonstrating what he
knew, to the great advantage of his pupils‚’' as well
as that power, characteristic of all great schoolmasters‚
of arousing their enthusiasm, and communicating to
them an intellectual impetus able to¹ carry them far
beyond the limitations of their teacher. After having
for thirty-three years presided over the school at
Deventer, Hegius died in 1498, leaving behind him not
“only his books and his clothes‚'' as tradition relates‚
but the enduring fame of having turned out such
scholars as BuschiuS‚ Caesarius, MurmelliuS, Mutianus‚
and. the great Erasmus himself.

Nor should we omit from the list of the alumni
of Deventer the name of Ortuinus Gratius—Ortwin
von Graes—in scholarship respectable, but damned to
everlasting fame as the butt of the keenest arrows
ever launched by relentless wit against arrogant
bi otry.

gIt will be seen, therefore, that the intellectual
condition of Germany at the dawn of the sixteenth
century was strikingly anomalous. Signs of awakening
from long sleep were everywhere manifest—except in
those seats of learning where they might have been
expected to be first observable. Free-lances were in
all directions ‘⁶ pricking on the plain‚” but they
met with scant hospitality within the portcullises of
the grim castles where Bigotry and Ignorance held
court, not without gross and sordid revelry. The
barbarous Latinity of the Middle Ages still sufficed
for aspirants for university degrees—-the lectures and
examinations of the various faculties implied no
higher attainment than rote-knowledge of the dogmas
