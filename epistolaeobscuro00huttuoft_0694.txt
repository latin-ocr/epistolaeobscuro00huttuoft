LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

is an unlawful art—as saith LXVI, Quest. X, Chap. O,
and in the Canon beginning “O ye asses!” and the

Holy Doctor agreeth therewith-—as well as Aristotle κς,

in the Ninth of his Physies, “Of Ignoranee.” There :fs
is moreover in the book much Hebrew, which the ἲ
Divines cannot read, and much Greek, but inasmueh
as they pay no heed to vanities such as these, but medi-
tate on higher things, they have appointed Johann
Bfefferleorn—-Christian, yet half Hebrew, for he is oft
ebrious—to examine it, lest mayhap poison should lurk

beneath the honey.

But of this anon, for we shall know all about it
come Frcmlffort fair, and then we can discuss these
matters with Doctor Orth'n, who goeth thither, as the
emissary of the Divines, to buy any new books exposed
for sale there, that they may examine them.

Ι have none other news to tell you, save that a
Doctor of the Order of Preachers in Strasburg, who
was always called Doctor «Iesus, hath fied from the
Convent‚ and many evil things are said eoneerning him
of which I dare not speak‚ and many scurrilous serib-
blers write verses to vilify him, and drop them in the
market-place and in the ehurch. This disquieteth me;
would that they would refrain themselves, lest they
fall into disfavour with the Preaehers. Amongst
others, Ι picked up the lampoon following :—

“ T hies, slanderer, sink of crimes unspeakable—
Worthy of life-long setters, or the stake—
Hater of pious priestS, effeminate,

Thy coward soul doth e'en in exile quake.
A holy abbess vietim of thy suares——
Satan’s best tool a monk ‹loth ever make! ’¹

See, now, what these gallows-birds are doing! They
have respect for no man, and by the Lord, the cause of
this is none other—‘⁶ non facit hoc aliud‚” as Alexander
very truly putteth it--than that evil habit of theirs of
writing and making verses coneerning everything that
happeneth at *S'trasbmgz Anon I will write to you
more fully concerning this matter.
