11: FRIAR BENEDJCT the SCOT to
fflagister Ort-evin Gratius

SENDETH brotherly and heartfelt love by way of
salutation.

Let me tell you, in reply to your question, that
your letter reached me on Michaehnas Day, and Ι
will now answer it categorically.

First, you ask why we Predicant Friars chant with
a louder voice than any others. I answer that I trow
it is for no other reason save that it is written in Isaiah
lix.‚ ‘⁶ We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall
lament as mournful doves;” and that I believe St.
Dominio desired to fulfil this prophecy.

Secondly, you ask whether Ι hold St. Thomas or
St. Dominio to be the holier? I answer that it is a
moot point, and that Doctors of our Order dispute with
one another concerning the matter. Some hold St.
Dominio to be the holier as touching his life, but not
as touching his doctrine3 and, on the other hand, St.
Thomas to be the holier as touching his doctrine, but
not as touching his life. Others contend that St.
Dominio is absolutely the holier, and this they main-
tain for two reasons: The first is that St. Dominic-
was the founder of our Order, and therefore that St.
Thomas, who was a member of the Order, was his
disciplet and the disciple is not above his master:
Q.E.D. The second is that learning hath no pre-
eminence over life and conduct, and that therefore,
perchance, St. Thomas was more learned than St.
Dominic- and yet not necessarily holier. Others again
will have it that St. Thomas is absolutely the holier,
inasmuch as no other Doctor among all the saints is
called the Holy Doctor except St. Thomas. Hence,
just as Aristotle is called ‘⁶ The Philosopher,'' and
Paul, “The Apostle,'’ so St. Thomas is called par
excellence “The Saint”; therefore, not only in learn-
ing but also in sanctity doth he excel St. Dominio,
