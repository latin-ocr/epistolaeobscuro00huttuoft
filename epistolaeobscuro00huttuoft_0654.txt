LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Reverend Heri· Magister, herewith I send your
excellence a notable and right profitable book. It
seemeth to me that this book is most skilfully com-
posed; it containeth very masterly propositions, and
is named “Rationale D1vinorum.'’ I bought it here,
at the fair, for Ι said to myself, “That is the book
for Magister Ortwin ‚f The Lord be praised that I have
lighted upon it! Now will Ι send it to him, just as
he lately sent me ιῙοΙιαηη Ιζβᾷῇἑνλῐυονφίε work entitled
‘J ohann Pfefferkorn's Defence against Calumnies‚'
which he compiled in the intent that it should be a
bulwark of the Holy Catholic Faith against ιῙοΙιαηη
Remmia and his followers‚ and wherein he flouted
them with many a shrewd gibe.'' But you may say,
‘⁶ Why doth this fellow send the book to me? Doth
he think that I have not plenty of books myself?''
Ι answer that such was far from my mind. lf indeed
you think that Ι was for this reason moved to send
you this book. you do me an injustice, for I do but
send it with fair intent. You must not believe that
I disparage you in that you possess but few bookS,
for I know that you have many. Indeed, when Ι was
in your study at Cologne Ι could see well enough that
you had a multitude of volumes, both great and small.
Some were elad in wooden boards‚ and some in parch-
ment bindings,—some were covered all over with
leather‚ red and green and black, while some were
half-bound. And there you sat, with a whisk in your
hand, to flap away the dust from the bindingS.
“Pardy1” said Ι, “Magister Ortwin, you have full
many a fair volume, and you hold them in high
esteem.” Then you replied that in this we might
know whether a man were learned or not3 for he
that honoureth books, honoureth knowledge3 and he
that honoureth not books, honoureth not knowledge.
And that saying Ι have laid up in my heart, and Ι will
keep it there world without end. Amen.

NAUMBURG.
