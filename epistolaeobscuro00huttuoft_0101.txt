IOANNES PELLIFEX

facit mihi magnam conscientiam. Nuper fui in missa

Franckfurdensi.

Tunc ivi cum uno baccalaurio per

plateam ad forum, et obviaverunt nobis duo viri qui
apparuerunt satis honesti, quantum ad aspectum, et 10
habuerunt nigras tunicas, et magna caputia cum liri-

pipiis.

Et deus est testis meus quod putavi quod sint

duo magistri nostri: et feci ipsis reverentiam, de-
ponendo birretum: tunc ille baccalaurius stimulavit
me, et dixit: “Amore dei quid facitis? isti sunt 15
Iudaei, et vos deponitis birretum vestrum ante eos:'’
ωηο ego ita fui perterrituS, ut si vidissem unum
diabolum. Et dixi3 ‘⁶ domine baccalaurie, parcat mihi

dominus deus, quia feci ignoranter,

Sed quid putatis,

utrum sit magnum peccatum ἓ ”

Et primo dixit quod videtur sibi, quod est peccatum
mortale, quia comprehenditur sub idolatria, et est
contra primum praeceptum ex decem praeceptis, quod

est “unum crede deum.”

Quia quando aliquis facit

honorem Iudaeo, vel pagano quasi esset Christianus, 25
tunc facit contra Christianitatem, et apparet esse met

⁷1nissa: Germ. Mass-Q· fair, or

market-day: originally used in the
sense of “Mass,” the word came to
mean the festival of a saint on which
a solemn mass was celebrated (8.9.
Martinmas), and then a fair, fre-
quently held on festival days—wit-
ness Bartholomew Fair, famous in
England for seven hundred years.
Cf. Du Cange, san: “Sed et inde
Germanis Missae nomen nundinis
publicis quae ad alicujus Sancti fes-
tum vel Ecclesiam celebrari solent:
verbi gratia Francfurtermisse.”

Π liripipiis: they were “liripi-
pionated,'' like Master Janotus de
Bragmardo (Rabelais, (ἕψῃ, i. 18).
The exact nature of the “ liripipium '’
has been variously described by
glossarists, and varied at different
epochs. Me'nage absurdly derived
the word from cleri ephippium (see
N. E. D.>. Du Gange defines it as
epomis (Le. ἐπωμίς, a shoulder-strap)
—“unde Belgis Liire-Piipe, seu
potius longa fascia, vel cauda caputii.''
It here means a long appendage of
the hood, that hung down when the
latter was thrown back, but was used
to secure it when drawn over the

head. For an illustration, see W.
Fairholt, Costume in Enyland, 1840,
p ²² peccatum mortale. It was not
until the XIIth Cent. that a serious
attempt was made to distinguish
moi-tal from venial sins, but thence-
forward the Schoolmen exercised a
vast amount of ingenuity with refer-
ence to the matter. Thomas of
WValden, in response to Wiclifs
challenge upon the subject, said,
“Nothing is clearer than the differ-
ence between them, nothing more
obscure than the line of demarca-
tion.” thile to those who held
that “an infinity of venial sins did
not amount to a single mortal sin,'’
it was clearly of the utmost import-
ance to distinguish them accurately,
insuperable difficulties arose, not only
from diversities of classification on
the part of authorities, but also from
the incalculable effects of extenuating‚
or aggravating, circumstances in re-
moving a sin from one category to
the other. For an exhaustive his-
torical account of the whole question,
see H. C. Lea, Hist. ofAuric. Crmj.
and Indulycmes, vol. i.
