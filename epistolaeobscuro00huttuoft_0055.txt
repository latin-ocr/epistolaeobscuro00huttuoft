pontiff will not claim for him a deep interest in matters
of theological controversy, yet he was destined to be
entangled in the fiercest struggles that had ever been
forced upon the Church.

When Hoogstraten's appeal reached him, Leo,
naturally enough, was disinclined to meddle personally
with the matter3 but he appointed a coinmission to
investigate the case, presided over by Dominico Gri—
mani-Cardinal of S. Marco, and Pietro Accolti—.—
Cardinal of S. Eusebio. The former was a man of
influence and enlightenment—Erasmus mentions his
library as one of the most splendid in Rome—and, being
a Franciscan, 110 was by no means prejudiced in favour
of the great rival Order.

The first step taken by the commission was, of

or their representative& Hoogstraten was summoned

though, as a matter of fact, he was not yet sixty, and
of sound health. Nothing, however, could have suited
the Dominicans better than this arrangement. The
inquisitor arrived in Rome with a well-filled purse—
or, to be more accurate, with liberal orders on the
bankers—-and was received with open arms by the
upholders of the Dominican Order at the Curia. For
some months all went smoothly. Hoogstraten was
lavish with his gold. His feasts were crowded with
‘⁶ Cu1·ialists”¹—the satirist represents the hangers-on
at court greedily sponging invitations to sup with
“the great Doctor from Germany, who hath come
hither to defend the Cause of the F aith.”

It need not, of course, be supposed that Hoogstraten
had resorted to any such crude procedure as actual
bribery of the princes of the Church, but civilisation
was in an advanced state at Rome, and there were
a hundred ways of delaying or expediting the pro-
gress of a suit, known to the legal underlings at the
Curia.

Reuchlin, on the other hand, found great difficulty
in even obtaining a proctor to represent him before the
