1.16] MATTHAUS HONIGLECKER

folk. But write and tell me how this matter standeth,
and any glad tidings I will scatter broadcast.

I said furthermore to your calumniator: “You
ought not to say such things, for even if Herr Orth'u
be base-born, he may have been legitimised; and if
he is legitimised then he is no longer a bastard, seeing
that the sovereign pontiff hath power to bind and to
loose, and ean make a bastard legitimate-——and con-
trariwise. Moreoven I ean prove from scripture that
you are blameworthy3 for it is written, ‘With what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again3’
but you mete with the measure of abuse, therefore
abuse shall be meted to you. Or I can prove it thus:
the Lord said: ‘ J udge not, that ye be not judged,’ but
thou judgest others, and slanderest them, therefore shalt
thou be judged and slandered.” 'l‘hen he replied that
my arguments were all flapdoodle and led nowhither3
and he was so stubborn as to deelare that if the pope
himself begat a son out of wedlock, and afterwards
legitimised him, the child would nevertheless in the
sight of heaven be a bastard and not true-born.

I trow the devil must be in these vagabonds‚ that
they slander you thus. I beseech you, therefore, write
to me, so that I may defend your good name3 of
a truth it would be seandalous for Doctor Reuclzlin
to be apprized that you were a bastard. But even if
you are, the fellow cannot certainly prove it, and if it
seem good to you, we will hale him before the Court
at Rome, and we will compel him to recant—the
Jurists know the way; and we will harry him at law,
and we will seize his benefiees when he incurs depri-
vation—for he holds a eanonry here at fllainz, and a
living elsewhere. 'Pake it not amiss that I write to
tell you what I have heard. My intent is of the best.
Farewell in the Lord‚ who shall keep thee in all thy
ways.
