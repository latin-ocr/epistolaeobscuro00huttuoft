unforgivable. “Ortuinus‚ qui est poeta eorum’'¹—-
‘⁴ Ortwin, that Poet of theirs”—such is the succinet
indictment in the words of “Ioannes Holcot.” It
cannot be improved upon. The fact that Ortwin
abased himself to become the kept humanist of the
Cologne theologians suffices to explain all. The light
of the new day had shone upon his face as upon the
other “Poets,” and yet—perhaps “for a handful of
silver'’—he had prostituted his scholarship in the
defence of the barbarians!

But there is a much more important bond of unity
between the various Letters of the Obscure Men than
the mere fact that they are addressed to a single person.
With all their diversity of aim, they scarcely ever fail to
contain some allusion to one absorbing topic. Rum-
blings of the Reuchlin controversy are heard, like the
drone q of a bagpipe, persistent amidst diverse airs.
Letters from Rome contain casual remarks to the effect
that things must be going ill for the Dominicans, since
Hoogstraten's clothes are—worse than shabby! 2 Others
are jubilant with the news that Reuchlin is growing
blind, or that he is reduced to beggary. Ortwin is
asked—Ortwin‚ of all men l—why he does not write
somewhat in defence of the Faith. In one way or
another, too, we are never allowed to forget for long,
through the mouths of their puppets, that the true
authors of the Letters recognise the vast principles
really at stake.

lt is for such reasons that some slight acquaintance
with the details we have endeavoured to explain—dry
and complicated though they perhaps may be—is abso-
lutely necessary for due appreciation of the satire as a
work of literary art. Given this key, the reader will
find no difficulty in gaining access to the treasures of
its wit and humour, and to its gallery of inimitable
portraits.

has not been determined. That it was late in 1515 or
early in 1516 is practically certain ; it is equally certain
