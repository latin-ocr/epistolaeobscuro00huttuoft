in a manner none could have foreseen. It is with
this central struggle that we are here concerned.

In the summer of 1505),ssv while the Emperor Maxi-
milian was preparing the fruitless siege of Padua‚
a strange visitor reached his camp and craved an
audience.

Johann Pfefferkorn (originally Joseph), a Jew by
birth, had embraced Christianity some three years
before, and with all a convert’s zeal had immediately

and deems him merely a fanatic, but a more recent
discovery of documents at Amsterdam1 shows that
Count von Gutenstein imprisoned him, and revives the
old suspicion that he took “ refuge in Christianity from
the punishment which his crimes had merited from the
hands of his countrymen.” Erasmus, indeed, later on
—under some provocation, it is true-——expressed his
opinion of Pfefferkorn by succinctly describing him as

Before a year had elapsed since his baptism there
had appeared in Pfefferkorn’s name a pamphlet entitled
Der Joeden, Spiegel, ‘⁶ The Mirror of the Jews,” to be
immediately followed by a Latin version of the same,
Speculum adhortationis chdaicae. Pfefferkorn him-
self was almost illiterate, and the appearance of the

and the collaboration of at least one of their allies
in his writings. The ‘⁶ Mirror ” contained little that
was noteworthy or new. Its arguments are ininatory,
rather than persuasive. The stubbornness of the
