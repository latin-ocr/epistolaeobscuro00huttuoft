1. 46] JOHANN WAGNER. V. AMBACH

Sifted from its Existentia?
And about Rollations he
Argued, till the Categories
Stood as stark as they could be.
Whether God within his heaven
The Predicaments enfold,
He discusseth : none before him
Matched him through the days of old 1

But enough of this: Ι would fain say—or write—some-
what concerning the poets.

There is one here who lectures on V (cleri aas· Maximus,
but he pleaseth me not half as well as you pleased me
when you lectured on Valerius Bsaa‘imus at Cologne,
for he merely expoundeth the text—but when you
treated of “The Neglect of Religion‚’' or ‘⁶ DreamS‚” or
“ Auspices,” you quoted Holy Scriptum, that is to say,
the Catemc Aurea of St. Thomas which is called the
Contimcmn, and Dmcmzdus, and other shining lights of
Theology, and you bade us note down these passages
from holy writ, and draw a hand beside them, and learn
them by rote. You must know that not so many
students matriculate here as at Cologne, for at Cologne
the students can be as the beggars here—and there
some students even steal their victuals, but this is not
allowed here, where all must have their commons in a
hostel, and be matriculated in the University.

But although they be few here, yet are they saucy—
to the full as saucy as the many at Cologne. Lately
they “staircased” a regent of the Hostel; he was
standing without a chamber, and listening to the
merrymaking within, when one of those within came
out, and finding him there threw him downstairs.
They are, moreover‚ so bold here that they fight with
the horse-patrol as they at Cologne do with the dray-
men, and they go about like patrols themselves with
drawn swords, and ropes, and sabres, and pieces of lead
attached to a cord, which they can throw and draw
back again. A little while ago the patrol smote a
student on the head so that he fell to the ground—
but he jumped up and thwacked and belaboured them
so that St. V (demine seized them and they all ran
awa .

There is still one other thing that you ought to know.
