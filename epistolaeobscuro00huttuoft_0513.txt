1. 38] PETERMANN KACHELOFEN

conclusion regular, it accords not with your intention;
for it would sound vainglorious to say, “sn-s, I am
named Gratius after that grace from on high which
God hath given me in Poetry and all things knowable '⁷
For this would seem to fit but ill with that lowliness
through which you received that grace, and argueth a
certain inconcinnity3 for supernal grace and pride
cannot coexist, since grace is a virtue, and pride is a
vice, and these are incompatible3 for ‘one of two
countiaries expelleth the other, as heat drives out
cold ”t as saith the poet, according to Petrus Hispanus
in the ‘⁶ 1³7·ced7?7÷(7777e777⁴(7‚’' who showeth that virtue is the
opposite of vice.

Another solution is therefore much to be preferred„¹
to wit, that Gratius is so named after the Roman
Gracchi, a letter being dropped for euphony’s sake.
Now concerning these Gracchi we read in Roman
History that they were very famous poets and orators, =
and that in Rome in those days their equals were not3
to be found, subtle and skilled as they 1n Poetry and ᾖ
Rhetoric. It 1s related, too, that their voices were soft ’-
and sweet, not strident and harsh, but dulcet as a flute. ἓ-
And sometimes it was to the sound of a flute that they
opened their discourses, wherefore the people listened
to them with the liveliest delight, and lauded them ἲ
above all others in that art. Now it was from these
Go (ιι-0177 that Magister 07 777777 was suinamed Gr atius. {
For, in tuin, no man is his equal in poetry, or in ²
dulcitude of voice. He surpasseth all, just as the ,
G? acclz7' overtopped all the poets of Rome. 'lherefore
the aforesaid poet of WzUttenbeog should keep silent and ἶ
humble himself: he is learned after a fashion, but com· ‘⁵
pared to you he is a child.

This second proof is adopted by myK familiar friends
Eobcm Hessus, Magister H67'7777'cl7 U7ba7777„s‘ Rarius
Ε7777ΐ7773, Magister Gemg Spalatz'n, Ul777l7 Hutten,
and especially Doctor Ludwig 7112'3707727227s,my honoured
friend and protector. Prithee, write and tell me which
are on the right track, and what is the truth of the
matter. And a mass shall be read for you that you
may get the better of Doctor Reaelzlin, who un-
deservedly dubbed you a heretic in that you wrote
