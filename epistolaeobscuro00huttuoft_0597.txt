11. 27] WILHELM STORCH

Most earnestly do I entreat you to resolve the
question that Ihave propounded. For if you hold that
the sin is mortal, then, Ι would fain get shrift here, ere
Ι return to Germangj.

You must know, too, that Doctor Jalcob von Hoch—
straten hath received a thousand florins through the
bankers‚ and I trow he will gain the day, and that the
devil will overthrow Jolzann Reuclelz‘n and the rest of
the Poets and Jurists, because they would fain with-
stand the Church of God—that is, the Theologians, on
whom the Church is founded, according to Christ’s
words—“Thou art Peter, and upon this rock Ι will
build my Church.”

And so I commend you to the Lord. Farewell.

Romu.

CI MAGISTER WILHELM STORCH §encletlz
many salutations to Mag. Ortwin Gratius

OW cometh it that you write much to me con-
cerning yourself, and nevertheless send me not
the book that you have indited against Jolzann
Reuclzlin ,ἲ
You tell me that you were full of inspiration when
you wrote that book, and that you believe it will be a
notable work, and that a publisher offered you twenty
florins to entrust it to him. You tell me moreover
that you will send me a copy to show to the Curialists
and scribes here, and vex them thereby‚ since they will
not believe that there are in Germangs poets as good as
there are in Italy. It is indeed most desirable that you
should send it to me. And yet you send it not——
although you are for ever promising it. I entreat you
to send me that book, or tractate, for I would fain
plague some clerks here who think that nobody else
understandeth aught. They scoff at my odeS, too,
when I write them, declaring them to be faulty. You
shall see for yourself whether this be true, for Ι send
herewith a poem that I composed of late when Doctor
