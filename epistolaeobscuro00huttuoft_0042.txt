INTRODUCTION

scholar was strangely attracted by Pico’s belief that in
the mysteries of the Jewish Cabbala lay the hidden clue
by which Platonic philosophy and Christian doctrine
might be shown to be but diverse aspects of one Truth.
Pico's discourse concerning ‘⁵ Secrete misteryes of the
hebrewes, caldyes and arabies,”1 as well as “ye olde
obscure philosophye of Pythagoras, trimegistus, and
orpheus '’ fired Reuchlin’s imagination. But to grapple
with the Cabbala without a competent knowledge of
the Hebrew tongue was, of course, impossible. Reuchlin
accordingly placed himself under the guidance of able
J ewish teachers‚ and made astonishingly rapid progress
in a language in which but few Gentiles had hitherto
even dabbled. In ordinary circumstances it would be
thought presumptuous in a student who had devoted
himself to a difficult language for barely two years to
publish a work upon the subject. But Reuchlin was
not an ordinary man, and, unlike many scholals, he was
eager to instil into the minds of others a desire to
follow in his own footsteps, and explore the almost
unknown fields where he had shown the way. Ac-
cordingly in 1494 there appeared from his pen, in the
form of a treatise De Verbo Dlz‘rffiCQ a glowing
panegyric on the Hebrew tongue. ‘⁶ In this divine
language,’' he says, “God speaks with men, and men
with angels, face to face, as one friend converses with
another.’' For several years Reuchlin’s name had been
Grecised, after the custom of the times, as Capnio, or
Capnion ² (though Reuchlin himself was chary of using
the “ humanistic '’ form), and the framework of the book
is a conversation between a rabbi—Baruchias‚ and a
Christian—Capnio. It is shown that all the religious
myster-ies of pagan nations, even the details of their
rituaL‘ ‘are but travesties of Hebrew truths concealed 1n
the words, and ev3en in the shapes of the letters, of the
Hebrew tongues

In 1496, Duke Eberhard I. having died, Reuchlin, .
ill at ease in the dissolute court of his successor,
migrated to Heidelberg, to be received with open arms
