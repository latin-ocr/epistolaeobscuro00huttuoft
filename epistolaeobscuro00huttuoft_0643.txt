In the fourth place you ask me my opinion about
Proper Nouns; whether they are wanting in a plural,

that is, two Kings or wise Roman Senators so named—
“three Maries‚’' that is, three women named sslary.

I have now answered you to the best of my ability ;
if Ι knew more I would answer you better. Take‚
then, my words in good part. Greet for me with
right good will Dr. Arnold von Tongern, mine own
esteemed preceptor. F arewell.
