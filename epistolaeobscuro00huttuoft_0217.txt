1. 35] LYRA BUNTSCHUCHMACHERIUS

venit unam preciosam margaritam, et ostendi eam
dominis meis Ioanni Grocino et Linacro dicens:
“ Videte, domini mei, videte, nonne iste magister noster
est formalis in latinisando et componendo dictamina, et
arte epistolandi?'’ Et iuraverunt quod non possunt
similes epistolas componere in arte latinitatis, quamvis
sunt poetae, graeci, et latini. Et extulerunt vos super
omnes qui sunt in Anglia, Frantia, Germania, et omni
natione quae sub caelo est. Ideo non esset mirum quod
vos estis generalis in vestro ordine, et quod rex in Gallia
diligit vos: non enim habetis similem in latinisando,
disputando, et praedicando3 ac scitis regem cum regina
optime informare in confessione. Etiam isti duo poetae
laudaverunt vos quod habetis artem rhetoricalem: verum
fuit ibi unus iuvenis socius, qui intitulavit se Richardum
Crocum; ille praesumpsit contra vos, quod non scribatis
secundum regulas artis rhetoricalis; verum fuit valde
confusus quando debuit probare. Ipse nunc stat in
Lypsi et discit logicam Petri Hispani: credo quod
postea erit cautior.

Sed accedo ad novitates. Schwitzenses et Lanssk-

¹³ Io. Groc. .· William (not John),

Marignano, mentioned below, did
Grocyn,c. 1446—1519‚ born at Colerne,

not take place till Sept. 13 of that

Wilts, and educated at winchester,
and New College, Oxford. ln 1488
he visited Italy, and studied Greek
under Chalcondylas. Returning to
Oxford, he was probably the first
publicly to lecture upon Greek in
that university. Among his pupils
were Sir Thomas More and Erasmus.
Though a firm upholder of the New
Learning, Grocyn never swerved
from the strictest religious ortho-
dossyzinacro: Thomas Linacre, c,
1460-1524, born at Canterbury3
Fellow of All-Souls College, Oxford,
1488. Like Grocyn, he visited Italy
and studied Greek under (3111110011-
dylas, and moreover counted More
and Erasmus among his pupils 011 1115
return to England. L. was King's
Physician under Henry V11. and
Henry V111.‚ and may be regarded as
the founder of the Royal College of
Physicians. He took priest’s orders
about four years before his death.

²³ Rey. cum γεμί. Since Louis XII.
died Jan. 1, 1515, and the battle of

91

year, it is clear that Francis I. and
Queen Claude are intended.

²⁷ Crocum: Richard Croke, ο. 1489-
1558; born 111 Lond0n3 graduated
at Cambridge in 1506. He studied
Greek under Grocyn at Oxford, and
under Hieronymus Aleander at Paris,
and lectured successively at Louvain,
Cologne, Leipsic, Dresden, and Cam-
In 1529 he was sent by
Cranmer 011 3 1111551011 to Italy con-
cerning the king's divorce. It is
known that he was at Leipsic in 1515.
Mutianus writing to Reuchlin, in
1515, remarks that Croke calls him-
self an Englishman, but that he
should have judged him a Greek,
such was his graceful fluency 111 that
tongue. Croke was on very friendly
terms with Reuchlin: “ My Capnion,”
he calls him 111 an extant letter.

³² Lansslmeehti. The Landsknechte
were so called, not from the long
lance with which they were armed‚
but from those German serfs who

foggin for their lords 011 foot. See
