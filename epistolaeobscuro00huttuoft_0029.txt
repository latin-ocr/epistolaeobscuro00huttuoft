dominating keep.
Any stru mg after pure Latinity was suspect
“For (saie they) it is not for the dignitee of holie
writte, our profession, that we should be compelled to
Jfolow any grammer r:ules which,” remarks ErasmuS‚
‘is a great maJestee of these Duns doctours, if to theim
J onely it be lawfull to speak false latine, notwithstanding

but worked upon Astronomy, Pure Mathematics, or
Physics, the discoveries of Galileo, Newton, and Faraday
might have been anticipated, and civilisation might
have already reached a stage of development not
destined to be attained for two or three centuries.

The human brain in the Middle Ages was, in fact,
an engine to the full as powerful and as subtle as it is
to- -day. but—the pity of it l-—its exquisite machinery
was made to waste much of its available energy in v ain
endeavours to weave cats' -cradles out of moonshine, and
in the fifteenth century it creaked at its task of re-
