IN TRODUCTION

Erasmus, he says: “It was by the emperor's own
command that Ι presented my Opinion upon the pro-
posed destruction of Hebrew writings. This Opinion
was, however, assailed by certain Tleeologians at
Cologne in language most unbecoming to Divines3
they heaped upon me foul obloquy and vulgar abuse
worthy of the vilest buffoons.’'¹ “Accordingly‚’' he
adds, ‘⁶ I set forth, as Ι was bound to do, a defence
of my character and my writings.'’

This Defence‚ which appeared early in September
1511, was entitled Augenspzfegel——referred to in Latin
as Speczolmtc Oculare, but the meaning of which was
made quite clear by the representation of a massive
pair of spectacles on the title-page.

In this vigorous counter—attack Reuchlin does not
mince matters. Pfefferkorn acted as a thief in stealing
the Opinion; the imputation of bribery is an abomin-
able lie, as Reuchlin's accusers are well aware; he
sets forth, on the other hand, more than thirty de-
liberate falsehoods that he has detected in the Haurit
*Spicegel—and he garnishes these solid arguments with
flowers of vituperation quite as gaudy as those of
his enemies. In those days, however, an omission
to provide such verbal decorations would have been
regarded as implying a doubt, on the part of the
writer, as to the righteousness of his own cause. So
far the Augempiegel was not unworthy of its author3
but it possesses other characteristics not so admirable.
Beneath its outward bravery signs of timidity are
not lacking. Reuchlin quotes the Opinion at full
length, but takes the opportunity of explaining away,
or modifying, some of its most liberal-minded passages.
He allows that parts of the Talmud may be hurtful
to Christianity‚ and while he reminds his readers that,
as ChristianS, they are bound to love the Jews, who
are their neighbours, he throws as a sop to his foes
the comforting assurance that even if Jewish manu-
scripts are saved from the flameS, their owners, at
all events, are sure of hell-fire. The writer admits,
however, that he cannot be reckoned among the
Theologians, and must not trespass on their province.
