INTRODUCTION

Nevertheless one weapon, and that the most potent,
remained neglected——because in those days for the
most part forgotten-—the withering might of ridicule.
But suddenly, at the close of 1515, “there was
launched from an unknown hand, a pasquil against
the persecutors of Reuchlin; it fell among them like
a bomb, scattering dismay and ruin in its explo-
sion.”1

This, a thin quarto volume of less than forty pages‚
was entitled Epistolae Obscuror'zcm Virorum acl vener-
abilem virum Illagv'strum Ortaz‘num, Gratiam Daventri-
ensem Coloniae Agrzppinae bonas litteras docentem .-
'oarijs ὃς locis 85 temporibus missae .· ac demam in volumen
coactae.

The point of the title was--or at least should have
been—immediately obvious. In the spring of the
preceding year Reuchlin had published a small collec-
tion of letters addressed to himself by sundry eminent
scholars and distinguished men, naming the volume
Clarorum Virorum. Epistolae latinae, graecae ἐς hebraicae
varijs temporibus missae ad Ioannem Ιέεῖιεῖιῖἰη7 Plzorcensem
LL. doctorem ‚· and Ortwin is supposed to publish
the epistles of his “obscure '’ correspondents, just as
Reuchlin had given to the world the select letters of
his illustrious friends. It is, indeed, difficult to under—
stand how, in the face of these patent facts, any
doubt could have arisen as to the precise meaning of
“ Obscuri Viri '³ ε the writers are obviously not intended
to be “Obscurantists,” or “Great Unknowns”—but
simply, and in the literal English sense, obscure men,
as opposed to men of eminence. Why Ortwin should
be represented as employing so humble an epithet‚
and whether he was not thereby made to cast some
slur upon his correspondents, are questions discussed
in the sequel, with abundant humour, by one of the
Obscure Men themselves.2

The plan of the satire is of the most simple, yet
brilliantly original kind. The foes of the New Learning
are made to display themselves—always without a trace
of self-consciousness—in all their doltishneSS‚ pedantry,
