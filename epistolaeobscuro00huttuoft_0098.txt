EPISTOLAE OBSCURORUM VIRORUM

doctores in sacra theologia non dicuntur doctores, sed
propter humilitatem et etiam sanctitatem, et propter
differentiam nominantur seu appellantur magistri nostri,
quia stant in fide catholica in loco domini nostri Iesu
Christi qui est fons vitae; sed Christus fuit nostrorum
omnium magister; ergo ipsi appellantur magistri nostri,
quia habent nos instruere in via veritatis, et deus est
veritas, quapropter merito vocantur magistri nostri,
quia omnes nos scilicet Christiani debemus et tenemur
audire praedicationem eorum, et nullus debet dicere
contra eos, ex quo sunt omnium nostrum magistri.
Sed ‘⁶ nostro-tras-trare ” non est in usu, et neque legitur
in vocabulario Exquo, neque in Catholicon, neque in
Breviloquo, neque in Gemmagemmarum, qui tamen
habet multos terminos: Ergo debemus dicere “noster
magistrandus,'' et non ‘⁶ magister nostrandus.''
