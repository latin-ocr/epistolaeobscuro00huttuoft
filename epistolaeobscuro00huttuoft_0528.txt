LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

not so greatly grieve; namely, that you have eonsorted
with a handmaid of Quentel's the printer—I speak not
as reproving you—and that by her you have had issue ;
I hear, too, that her master sent her paeking, and would
not suffer her to remain in his house—so she now liveth
in her own home and maintaineth herself by tailoring.

I beseeeh you by the mutual friendship we have
ever had, tell me whether this be sooth. For a long
while have Ι had hankerings after her, but was afeared
by reason of her maidenhood. If, however, you have
done this, then, with your permission, we will maintain
her in common: I to-day and you to-morrow——the
worthiest first3 I a Doctor, you a Magister. (Ι put
it thus bluntly without intending any slight.) And
thus, in seereey, will we lnaintain her and the child
at our common charge. She, l know, will be well
content, and Ι trow that if Ι consorted with her for a
while, Ι should be healed. I desire to purge my reins,
and to become whole.

And now, farewell. If Ι had Ποῖ been plagued
with this flux Ι would have come to you, instead of
writing. In haste, from our Hostel.

semletle mans] greetings to Mag. Orttcin Gratius

*EEING that you lately wrote to me, asking how
it fareth with me at Heidelberg, and what Ι
think of the Doctors and Magisters here. Ι must tell
you that so soon as Ι arrived at Heidelberg I was
appointed cook at a hostel, where Ι receive my victuals
and certain lnonies by way of guerdon‚ and am thus
enabled to proeeed Magister, in due course. Harrgj the
Pom· did the like, who, having neither books nor paper,
wrote all ou his leathern jerkin. In like manner
Plautus maintained himself, who carried saeks to the
mill like an ass, and nevertheless became a very learned

author, who wrote both verse and prose.
