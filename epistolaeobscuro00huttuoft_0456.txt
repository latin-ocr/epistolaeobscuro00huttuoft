LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Unknown to them the Seraph Doctor—he
Without whose lore none can Physician be;
The Holy Doctor is to them unknown,

Who Porphyrys and the Stagirite alone
Expoundeth with a comment ever true-

Of Aristotle fitting for the Schools.

And hence inanely jabber all the more3

As did these windbags, braggart and loquacious,
Against our Masters, with words contumacious:
Let but Hoogstraten nab them, and 'tis plain
The faithful they will never plague again!

Fare ye well, and salute sor me with all reverence
the worshipful Magisternosters Arnold von Tongeru,
Remigius, V alentin von Geltersheim, Herr Jakob von
Gouda, of the order of Preachers-most subtle poet-
and the rest.

—You must know that there is a terrifying rumour afoot
here, and it is in all men's mouths, that at the Roman
Court the cause of the Theologers is in evil case. For
they say that the Pope is minded to confirm the sentence
pronounced a year agone at Βρίγας in favour of Doctor
Reucltlz‘n J
When this came to my ears I had such a fright that
Ι could not utter a word, but became like a dumb man,
and I slept not for two whole nights. But Reuchlin's
friends make merry, and strut hither and thither, bruiting
this report. As for me, 1 should not have given heed to
