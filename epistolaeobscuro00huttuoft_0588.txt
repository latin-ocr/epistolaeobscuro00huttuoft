LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

and that the Count von IVeuemcr has been elected
the new Bishop. If this be true I must say that the
Canons of Cologne are great fools, since Poet and
Bishop are a pair of opposites. It is ill, too, for the
cause of the Faith, for the Count is a stubborn ally
of Reuclclin. A certain Curialist told me that when
he left Cologne for Italy the Count gave him a letter
to take to &Reuclalim and I have heard from others

[s that he consorteth with many poets, and new f-angled
Theologians like Emsmm of Βοΐΐεφιίαῃῑ. When Ι was
in Usu? zbmg, there was a poet there, [Which] Hutten
by name, who was ev ei deriding and girding at the
Theologians and Masters of Arts· , and sitting at table
in an Inn, he told another person of quality that he had
that very day sent the Count a letter. Then quoth
the noble, “ What do you write about, when you write
thus to one another?” And he made answer that he
wrote to urge the Count to do good diligence in the
Cause of the Faith, and to work for Rene-lehn against
the Theologians, so that they should not commit the
Augenspiegel to the fiames; and that he heartily com-
mended Remlzlin to him3 and he av eried that he
loved Reuclclin as his own father: but Ι held my peace,
lest he should suspect that I was on your side. And
for this reason it is not good for that man to be made
Bishop. But I hope the rumour lieth. Tell me, then,
the whole truth‚ and fare ye well from the soles of your
feet to the crown of your head. as saith Esaias.

received the letter which you drew up at Cologne.

The said letter was dated on St. Allcwgaret's Day, but
it reached me on St. Bartholomew's Day; and when I
received it I cried, ‘⁶ The devil! that letter was written

a long time ago, and Herr Ortwin will be nettled with
