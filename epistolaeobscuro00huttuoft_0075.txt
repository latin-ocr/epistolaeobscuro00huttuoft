circle, who thus became involuntary missionaries of
humanism. In 1510 Crotus actually entered the
convent at Erfurt, and perhaps took holy orders,

But such a man could ill brook the confinement of
the cloister. He never ceased to correspond with his
friends outside the walls, and in a letter to Mutian he
complains that there is nothing to do save to kill time
“by drinking, gaming, carnality or usury.” To live
away from his intellectual equals seemed to him ‘⁶ worse
than to live as a beast in a herd.'’ Accordingly, in 1512,
when Mutian’s little band—including Eoban Hesse
and Hermann Buschius—had reassembled, Crotus was
naturally from time to time once more found in their
midst.

Among the diverse theories which, as we have
mentioned, have at one time or another been mooted
with reference to the authorship of the Epistolae,
Crotus’s share is seldom in doubt.

There exists, indeed, direct proof of this, apart from
the overwhelming internal evidence afforded by the
satire itself. Let us, for a moment, pass on to the
year 1531. During the sixteen years that had elapsed
since the first publication of the Epistolae, great events
had happened, precursors of yet more significant ones
which were shortly to follow. Most men of eminence
had been compelled to declare themselves openly upon
the side of Luther or of Rome. But there were a few
who still faced both ways, and a few whose impetuous
advocacy of the Reformation had not only been
checked but followed by reaction. Among the latter
was CrotuS. He states his position quite candidly in
a letter to Albrecht of Brandenburg (1531). After
admitting that he had for several years been an ardent
supporter of the reformers, the writer continues, ‘⁶ But
when Ι perceived that they held not sacred even those
things which had been handed down to us from Apos-
tolic times, and that one sect did but engender another,
it came to my mind that Satan might be using the
Scriptures as a stalking-horse, and disseminating evil
under the mask of goodness. I was therefore minded
to abide in the Church in which Ι was baptized and
nurtured. And notwithstanding that there be faults
