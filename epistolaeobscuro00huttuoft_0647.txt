11. 50] ADOLFUS CLINGESOR

Chapter of the Book of ΖεμΙιαφιίαΙι, where saith the pro-
phet, ‘ And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will
search Jerusalem with candles, and will punish the men
that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, &c.’
Now since you men of Cologne make bold to wrest the
scriptures after your own good pleasure, hearken how Ι
interpret those words of the prophet. The Lord saith,
by the mouth of the prophet, ‘And it shall come to
pass at that time that I will search J erusalem,' that is
to say, Ι will visit my Church, to the end that I may
reform her, and remove whatsoever errors may be within
her; and Ι will do this ‘ with candles’-—that is, by the
mediation of enlightened men, such as are Erasmus of
Rotterdam, Johann Reae-lilim, and DIutz'anuS Rzffzcs, and
others in Germany ; and ‘ I will punish the men ’-that
is, the Theologians ; ‘ settled '—that is, obstinately
bigoted3 ‘ on their lees '—that is in a sorry, misty, and

Theologians who walked in the true light of the Holy
Writ. Knowing neither the Latin, the Greek, nor the
Hebrew tongue, they cannot understand the Scriptures.
Therefore, casting aside the veracious and primitive
Theology, they do naught but dispute, and wrangle,
and moot unprofitable questions. And in so doing they
declare that they are defending the Catholic Faith‚ not-
withstanding that there are none among the disputants
who attack the Faith. And thus to no purpose do they
spend their days, and do not advantage the Church of
God. If, indeed, their disputations were of any profit,
they could turn them to account in the service of the
faith of the Catholic Church, by journeying throughout
the world and preaching God’s VVord, as did the
Apostles, and convincing the Greeks that they should
come. again into union with the Church of Rome. Or,
if they wish not to wander far from home, at least let
them go amongst the Bohemians and put that folk to
silence with their Arguments and Syllogisms. Never-
theless they do none of these things, but wrangle con-
cerning unprofitable matters. Therefore will the Lord
punish them, and will send among them Doctors learned
in Greek, and in Latin, and in Hebrew‚ who, purging
