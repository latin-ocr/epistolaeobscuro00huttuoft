went. For as we all sat in silence, he began to hold
forth in a mighty long preamble.

But of this—else am Ι 110 true-born man—I under-
stood not a single word, by reason that he had such a
wee little voice; Ι think he did in some sort handle
theology, and this to engage a certain Magister Noster,
a man of vast profundity in matters theological, who
sat with us at board. ⁷

Thereupon, when Erasmus· had concluded that pre-
lude, the Magister Noster began to argue with great
subtlety concerning entity and essence-—but it skilleth
not that I should recall his words, for you are well
versed in such matters. XVhen he had finished,
Erasmus replied‚ but briefly, and once more we all sat
silent. Our host, therefore, who is a humanist of parts,
fell to some discourse on Poetry, and greatly belauded
Julius Caesar, as touching both his writings and his
valorous deeds. So soon as I heard this, I perceived
my opportunity, for Ι had studied much, and learned
much under you in the matter of Poetry, when Ι was
at Cologne, and Ι said, “Forasmuch as you have begun
to speak concerning Poetry, 1 can therefore no longer
hide my light under a bushel, and I roundly aver that Ι
believe not that Caesar wrote those Com=me7zmries3 and
Ι will prove my position with argument following,
which runneth thus: VVhosoever hath business with

get Latin. In truth, therefore, I believe that it was

none other than &colonius who wrote those Commen- ··

tardes, for I have met with none who hath a style liker
to Caesar's than Suetonz‘us.''

After I had this spoken, and much else which
here, for brevity's sake, Ι set not down—since, as you
know from the ancient saw, “The moderns delight in
brevity'’—-E7⁴asm2as laughed, but said nothing, for Ι had
overthrown him by the subtilty of my argument. And
so we made an end of the feast, and I propounded not
my question in the Art of Medicine, for Ι well knew
that he could not resolve it, since he could not answer
me that argument in Poetry. He, a poet! Pardy, Ι
