11. 18] SIMON WURST

assembhes, or when students and Dominicans come to
his house, or when he goeth to the baths. Sonty! how
many sermons hath he not heard in twelve years!
How many exhortations ! How many opinions of the
holy fathers! And these he could either lay up in his
own mind, or dictate to his wife, or scratch upon the
walls, or enter in his notebook. Ι added, moreover‚
that Jolzann Ifffcffi'rlrorn avoweth of himself—without
boasting—that he can apply, without help, everyth-ing
contained in the Bible or in the Holy Gospel, to any
purpose, good or evil, and that in German or in Hebrew.
He knoweth too, by rote, all the gospels that are read
throughout the year, and he can recite them to the
letter—and this is more than the J urists and Poets can
do. He hath, moreover, a son named Loren:—a right
towardly youth—-who studieth until he hath grown
pale; I marvel however, that he is allowed to study
those diabolical poetS. He gathereth for his father
saws from the Orators and poets-both personally and

he for lack of learning cannot attain to, his son
despatcheth.

Let them therefore be put to shame who have
falsely spread it abroad that Jolzaom Rfcfferk‘orn hath
not composed his own bookS, but that they have been
written by the Doctors and Magisters at Cologne: let
Jolzcmn Reuelclin, too, blush, and groan to all eternity,
in that he declared that Pfefferkorn composed not the
Hcmdspiegel himself — concerning which there hath
been before now much discussion amongst the learned
—since three men furnished him with the authorities he
citeth therein. One asked me, saying, “What three men
be they?'’ And I replied that I knew not, but that
I deemed them to be the same three men who appeared
unto Abram, of whom we read in the Book of Genesis.
But when Ι said this they all made mouths at me, and
mocked me as if I was a greenhorn. Would that the
devil would smite them with heavy blows, as it is
written in the book of Job, which just now in our
