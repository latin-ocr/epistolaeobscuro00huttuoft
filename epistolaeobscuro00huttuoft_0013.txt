PREFACE

THIS volume presents for the first time to English
readers an annotated edition—accompanied by a trans-
lation—of a work that ranks not only as one of the
most famous of Satires, but as an historical document
of no little moment.

Of the Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum it may be
safely said that—at all events in England——no work
less known is more often mentioned. Frequent allu-
sions to the Epistola& are, indeed, inevitable. Their
historical importance few can dispute. No writer on
the general aspects of the later Renaissance, or on the
German Reformation, can well disregard them.

The contemporary influence of the Satire itself 1n
sapping the foundations of an already crumbling schol-
asticism, and laying bare ecclesiastical abuses, will be
touched upon in the Introduction; but for the student
of modern history to-day, its value lies in the fact that
it teems with references to the protagonists in the great
controversy which raged round Reuchlin during the
early years of the sixteenth century, ‘⁶ dividing Western
Europe in two hostile camps,” and that it is pregnant
with presage of the mighty change soon to sweep over
Teutonic Christendom. The side-lights, moreover, that
it throws upon the social life of the period—its manners
and its morals—-are of no small interest. The reader
feels that the corner of a curtain has been lifted, and
that he is permitted actually to peep at a phase of the
life of four centuries ago which if we had had to rely
solely upon prim and formal history might have been
lost to us for ever, but that history must take into
account if it is to render intelligible the remarkable
phenomena that attended the dawn of the Renaissance
north of the Alps.

It 1s, however, in their literary aspect that the Epis-

tolae must claim their place among the immortals.
