INTRODUCTION

the orthodox historiam and the courageous satirist were
of one mind after all, but whereas the first two merely
deplored the licence referred to, the last boldly attacked
it with the darts of ridicule and scorn.

It has been, in every age, the sate of satire to be
misunderstood. It is a risk that every satirist must be
prepared to run. When Swift suggested the addition
of stewed babies to the gourmet's bill of fare, he
probably foresaw that he would be stigmatised as a
preacher of cannibalism‚ and when the authors of the
Epistolae emptied the vials of their scorn on the ignorant,
the greedy, and the impure, they well knew, as men of
the world, that there would not be wanting those who
wosslld straightway accuse them of folly, gluttony, and
pro igacy.

On the other hand, to defend the authors of the
Epistola& from the charge of cruel unfairness in their
attacks upon individuals would be a hard, if not an
impossible, task. “Their victims are treated like
vermin3 hunted without law, and exterminated with-
out mercy.” In a spirit of remorseless mischief the
writers snatch the cowl from Hoogstraten the in-
quisitor, and, grinning, show us a crafty, cruel face
beneath ε they dare to foully smirch the vestal raiment
of Arnold von Tongern; they impishly clap a dunce’s
cap on the learned pate of Ortwin Gratius, and stick
him in his niche, an object of everlasting derision. As
for Pfefferkorn‚ the renegade, boastful descendant of
Naphtali “ the hind let loose ’'——they affix to his brows‚
in lieu of phylactery, a pair of shameful antlers, and
drive him with gibes and threats to join the wittol
herd. To reach their victims they thrust a pre-
sumably chaste matron⁷s reputation in the mire. No
excuse is possible. Palliation there may be, in the
manners of the time: the days of chivalry were over.
Nevertheless, for us, the forms of maligned wife and
slandered ascetic loom dim and unreal through the
mists of four hundred years:

“Their bones are dust,
Their souls are with the saints, we trust.''
