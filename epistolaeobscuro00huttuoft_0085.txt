INTRODUCTION

J eshuruns who waxed fat in sloth‚ and kicked against
these wise and salutary rules of their Orders——ever
scheming to evade them. It was men such as these
who were the objeets of the satirists’ seorn. But while
the writers saw before them an Augean stable which
it would task the energies of a reforming Hercules
to eleanse, it had not entered into the head of any
one of them that it would be better to pull it down.

That Crotus, Hutten‚ or indeed any of the Erfurt
circle, had a definite notion whither the tendencies
they were fostering would ultimately lead is altogether
improbable. Eoban Hesse lived and died a genial
humanist; Mutian retired early from the fray, and,
deprived of his revenues during the Peasants' War,
passed away orthodox, pennileSS‚ and weary of the
world3 Crotus‚ as we have seen, recoiled in something
like dismay when he came to the parting of the
ways,

Hutten's case, it is true, was different. He threw
in his lot with Luther and the reformers heartily
enough, and did not draw back—yet it is always clear
that political and patriotic, rather than doetrinaL motives
actuated him. In his ironieal Dedication to Leo X. of
Lorenzo Valla's tractate on the Donation of Constantine
(1517) Hutten nowhere touches on matters of saith
and dogma: his attaek is solely directed against the
scandalous sale of indulgenceS‚ the compositions for
frauds, the intolerable taxes, and the hundred and one
other ways in which Rome extorted from the merchants
and peasants of the Fatherland the wealth she required
for the aggrandisement of an extravagant court and an
ambitious pontiff.

We may, in fact, conveniently elassify the reform-
ing tendeneies of the age under four heads, overlapping
doubtless, but yet distinet in the main. First, a purely
intellectual revolt against the bondage of scholasticism‚
due chiefly to the revival of classica] learning: seeondly,
a moral reaetion—by no means the earliest—against
monkish profligaey and hypocrisy: thirdly‚ a political
and eeonomie rebellion against the temporal authority
of Rome, and her consequent exactions; lastly, the
“Reformation'’ proper, which practically aimed at
