EPISTULAE OBSCURORUM VIRORUM

memoro illam doctrinam, quam dedit mihi semel
magister noster Valentinus de Geltersheim in bursa
Montis, quando fui suus discipulus, et volui audire
Salustium. Et dixit, “quare vis audire Salustium, tu
dischole?'’

Tunc ego respondi, quod magister Ioannes de Vrati—
slavia dixit, quod discimus bona dictamina facere ex
talibus poetis Tunc ipse dixit: ‘⁴ est fantasia, sed
tu debes bene advertere in partibus Alexandri, et
epistolis Caroli, quae practicantur in aula grammatic-
orum; ego nunquam audivi Salustium, et tamen
scio dictamina facere metrice et prosaice.’' Et sic
magister noster Valentinus fecit quod ego nunquam
studui in poetria. Et isti humanistae nunc vexant
me cum suo novo latino, et annihilant illos veteres
libros, Alexandrum, Remigium, Ioannem de Garlandia,

(Carolus Virulus). He was author of
a very popular, if inept, treatise on
letter-writing, “Epistolae Karoli''
(bitterly criticised by Bebelius).
Mennicken was Rector of the Paeda-
gogium Lilii, at Louvain, for fifty-six

hard, of Geldersheim (a village* in
Franconia, Bavaria, on the W'ern,
near qurtzburg), Canon of Cologne
and Rector of the Univ. in 1503.
(See Ep. ii. 29.) He was nicknamed

the “fox-hunter‚'’ or “student-trap-
per‚’⁷ iu consequence of the assiduity
with which he sought students for his
hostel. He died in 1526. Bianco,

(cited by Bijcking) The tribulations
of one of von Geltersheim’s touts are
amusingly described in ii. 29.

³³ medion: to hear lectures upon.
Cf. ii. 46, “Volunt audire Virgilium
et Plinium et alios novos aut01·es.’'

³⁴² diselmle: a somewhat difficult
word. “J)iseolu.s·, difficilis, morosus’'
(Du Gange). “Discors a schola3
diversas scholas visitans'’ (Diefen—
bach). “A sham or froward student '⁷
(Rashdall, i. 432). Cf. ii. 63. The
word occurs in a letter from Mutian
to Urban, July l, 1510. “ Adeo
δύσκολος, irrevereuS, superbus.”

³⁵ Ioannes? Bijcking suggests that
this is Joannes Borscus, of Breslau,
mentioned in a letter from Petrus

Gratius, 1508.

opposed to the Medieval Latin of the
“ veteres libri.'’

⁴⁵ Remigium: Remigius the Gram-
marian wrote a commentary on the
Ars Parra of Donatus. The best
known work of Remigius is, however,
usually cited as Dominus que Pars.
The earliest known edition has for
its title: “Dominus que pars. (In
presenti libello continentur⁹ haec.
Primo Remigius seu dominus que
pars. Secundo ordo constructibilium.
Tercio regimina. Quarto regule
congruitatum. Quinto metra con-
structionum. Sexto comparationes.)
Impressus in caesarea civitate Lubi-
eensi. 1489.'’ The Fundamentum
scolarium of Remigius is merely
an enlarged edition of the sanie
work.

who were not acquainted with Gar-

places him in the xlth Ceut„ but it
