LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

indite somewhat and send it to you. You desire me
likewise to send you some news; all Ι know is that
there are here three eminent Theologians who are of
high renown among the GermanS‚ and cause us to be
of good and laudable report throughout the Curia. Two
of these you know well—the Reverend Father Herr
Magister—noster Jalsob vem. H oogstraten‚ (in the Latin
tongue, (le Alta platea), and Herr Magister-noster Peter
ffleyer, of Frankfort, Pastor. The third is Herr Kaspar,
Preacher at Isempten, Licentiate in Sacred Theology,
and ere long to become Magister-noster.

They are here occupied with three notable Causes.

The first, Magister-noster Just-ob, maintaineth the
Cause of the Faith against Johamz Reuelzlin, who they
say is a heretic; and they say well, for so he is. The
second, Magister-noster Peter, instituteth a suit con-
cerning competenee against the Canons of Frankfort,
inasmuch as they will not yield him his competence‚
and therefore he hath come hitherto Court, and harrieth
them woundily. The third, Herr Isaspcm maintaineth
a suit concerning certain sacred oil, against certain
monks who dwell without the walls of Kefmptera and
hoard this sacred oil; and when folk should be aneled
the sacred oil is not forthcoming. VVherefore the afore-
said Licentiate desireth to correct those monks and
compel them to yield the oil to the Burg for the common
good of the inhabitants. Ι have no other news to relate ;
and from you Ι have heard naught. [I know not indeed
the cause wherefore I have merited your reverence's
neglect] And now I commend you to the L01·d—

May he you in peril save,

Make you as a lion brave,

Wise as prudent Solomon‚

Fair of face as Absolon,

Holy as the Baptist‚ John,
Wealthy as Ahasuerus‚

And poetic as Homerus.

Perish Reuchlin! and the crew
Of ungodly poets, too—-

Humbly they might leam of you l

Lo! while I was not minded to write poetry, neverthe-
less I have dropped into verse. How this came to pass
