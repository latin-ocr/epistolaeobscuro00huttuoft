up—Johcmn Reuclelin, Erasnms of Rotterdam, one
lVilibctld—something or other—with Ulriele Huttem
Hermann Bzcscle, and ,ΜΛ-οῖ) I‘Vimplzeling, who wrote
against the Augustinians, and Sebastiam Brant, who
wrote against the Dominicans—the pity of it! and
wantonly rails at them. Thereby many scandals arise
within the F aith, and Ι 6311 well share your belief, for
Ι have read that such happenings will immediately
precede the Last J udgment. Moreover I will declare
to you somewhat else, to wit that Ι have heard (it was
told me as truth by a Father Superior) that Anti-
Christ hath been born, but is as yet a child. He told
me, too, that a revelation had been made to a certain
C arthusmn Monk, who, as he was sleeping in his cell,
heard a voice from heaven 61)·1113, “The world shall
perish! The world shall pelish! The world shall
perishl’ 'lhen the monk scal-,ed and would fain have
spoken, but silently made supplication against the 111165
of the Devil. 'lhen once more began the 10166 10 cry
out—and yet again a third time. Then perceiving in
1115 heart that it was the voice of the Lord, he cried‚

“thy, Lor'd2' and the voice (111511·616(1,6 ‘By reason
of its sins.” Then cried the Monk, “W hen, Lord?''
and the voice answered, “There are yet ten years. ”

W herefore Ι go in great dread. W hen I passed
through Bologna Ι heard that 111616 1135 a citizen
there 11110 113(1 3 familiar Spirit called Billa.- and that
wondrous spirit speaketh to him concerning the King
of ance, and the Emperor, and the Pope, and the
end of the world. I have read his prophecies. And
now, Ι have told you what I know, and commend you
to the Lord.

The Romus Cunm.
