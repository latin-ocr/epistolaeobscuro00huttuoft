11. 32] HEINRICH SIEBMACHER

labour it is to frame theses, for you told me at (f'ologne
that you could searee put together a seemly exereise in
a sennight. You cited Horace to me——how that poet
hath laid it down that we ought to spend nine years in
the inditing a fair treatise. And that, Ι trow, is the
manner fit. For it behoves us to be wary, and to take
heed that there are no false coneords. Sometimes
congruity suffieeth not, for embellishments are needed—
aeeording to the twenty preeepts of the Elegmztiae,
and the Art of Letter-writing of Pontias, or of Paulus
Schneevogel, who was Magister of Leipsz‘c. Those
Poets too, now-a-days, are vengeanee captious, and
when one writes anything they straightway cry, ‘⁶ See,
in this place and that, there is sorry latinity ἱ ” and they
come here with their new-fangled whim-whams, and
subvert the good old grammar. And so I cannot write
amidst such heat as this. Therefore Ι pray thee hold
me excused. Farewell.

Abbot! I 3111 in great fear, for an Assessor just now
said to me, “If I were you, Ι would not appeal, sor
you are in the wrong:” and therefore I know not
what to be at. I trow that this year is an ill-starred
one for Theologians; for even that eminent man,
Herr Magister-noster Peter Bleyer prospereth not in
his cause against the Canons of Frcmkfort, and they
harry that pious and devoted father. It seemeth to
me that the Canons aet thus on Jolumnv Reuehlm's
behalf, whom they love for his poetry’s sake. And
therefore, being minded to do him a pleasure, they bait
the good pastor, who is mightily at loggerheads with
Johann Reaclzlin—and rightly, for he representeth his
