that copies of the Letters, or of some of them, had, like
other productions of that day, been circulated privately
for some time before their publication—as early, indeed,
as 1514} In a letter to Erasmus, dated October 19
(1515), WVolfgang Angst, a learned reader in Anshelm's
printing-offiee at Hagenau, refers to the “Obscure
Men '’ and to certain writings of theirs which accompany
his letter: he humorously declares that he cannot re-
fuse the rascals' shameless request, for they have re-
minded him how Erasmus used to reeite passages from
their productions when he was at Strasburg not long
before, and that, after all, it was his own Praise of F ollgs
(1511 ), which set them an example. Angst declares that
he was overeome by their malapert importunity, and
therefore, ‘⁶ reliqui vela ventis ; superest ut dieculae
hospitium non deneges iis, quos tui tam cupidos fuisse
eo nosels. '²
gThe first and second editions of the Epistolae eon-
tained only forty-one letters, but after a few months
a third appeared, with an Appendix of seven new letters,
the last purporting to be sent from Rome by Hoog-
straten. There were more to follow, but further men-
tion of these may eonveniently be deferred.
The book immediately gained a widespread popular
success, but for diverse reasons. ‘⁶ It does one's heart
good to see how delighted everybody is with the Epis-

tolae Obscurorum lUrormnss' wrote Sir Thomas More to ‚

Erasmus, in 1516, “The learned are tiekled by their
humour, while the unlearned deem their teaehings of
serious worth. then we laugh, they think we do but ¹
deride the style; this they do not defend, but they
deelare that all faults are eompensated by the weight
of the matter, and that the rough scabbard contains a
brilliant blade! Would that the book had appeared
under another title 2 Ι verily believe that in a hundred
years the dolts would not pereeive the nose turned up
at them—though longer than the snout of a rhino-
ceros!”³
