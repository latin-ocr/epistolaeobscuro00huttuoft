LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

burg, journeying from Heidelberg, to purchase certain
drugs that, as Ι believe you know, we use in our
medicamentS. For it is the eustom amongst your
physieians‚ if aught be lacking in their storeS, to pro-
eeed elsewhither to proeure it for the practice of their
Art. But let this pass. As soon as I arrived hither,
there came to me a good friend, and one very well-
disposed towards me; you know him well, for he was
for a long while under your ferule at Cologne—and he
told me of a man named Erasmus of Rotterdam, of
whom Ι had never heard, but who is profoundly skilled
in all knowledge and in every braneh of learning. This
man, he told me, was even then at Strasburg. (I could
not believe, and I yet cannot bring myself to believe,
that a man so small as he is could know so much.)
Thereupon I earnestly begged my friend to bring me
to Erasmus that Ι might see him. I had with me a
note-book that I eall my medical V ade-meeum-—for Ι
always carry it with me when I walk abroad to visit

art. Out of this notebook, therefore, Ι eulled me a
question with all the comments thereon‚ and the argu-
ments pro and eon, and armed with these Ι purposed to
beset this man whom they deem so learned, and make
trial whether he knew somewhat of Medicine‚ or not.
Now when Ι told my friend my intent, he made a great
feast, and bade to it speculative TheologianS, and
Jurists of high renown, and myself as a representative,
all unworthy, of the Art Medicinal.

Now, when we were set, for a long while there was
a silence, and from modesty no man would break it;
then I nudged my neighbour, for of a sudden—heaven
knoweth how—there rushed into my mind :—

“ Conticuere omnes, intentique ora tenebant.''

This verse I still have fresh in my memory, for when
you expounded to us V irgz‘l in his Eneid, 1 limned
beside it a man with a bolt on his mouth, to mark the
passage, as you bade us.
At the last it was fairly brought to the proof,
whether that wiseaere was indeed a poet, as the report
