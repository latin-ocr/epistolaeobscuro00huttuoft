I.13] CONRAD OF ZWICKAU

him, that would not make him a bad man, for to err is
human. You send me whole sereeds about that sin—
whieh is not the worst sin in the world—and you quote
texts without end. Ι very well know that it is not a
virtue, and yet it is recorded in Holy Writ that certain
rnen thus erred, and yet were saved. Samson, to wit,
had dealings with a bona-roba, and nevertheless the
spirit of the Lord afterwards came upon him. I can syl-
logize against you thus z—-“ Whosoever is not unrighteous
receiveth the holy spirit; but Samsonwas not unrighteous,
ergo, he received the holy spirit. ” Ι can prove the major
premiss—for it is written, ‘Into an unrighteous soul the
spirit of wisdom shall not enter3 but the holy spu 1t is the
spirit of wlsdom ,ergo‚ &0⁹⁹ 'l he minor premiss is manifest,
for if that sin of incontinenee is so grav‚e then the spirit
of the Ι ord would not have come upon S·,am.50n as it is
told us in the Book (gf J uclges. We read, too, of Solomon,
how he had three hundred queens, and conoubines with-
out number——and he was prince of gallants to his dying
day. Nevertheless, the Doctors, with one accord, de-
clare that he found salvation. What then? I am not
stronger than Samson, nor wiser than Solomon, and so I
must needs be wanton‚ once and again, Moreover the
physicians say it is sov ran Ἥ,Ἳξιςὲῖὶωῖ melaQewlLQly„ Fie!
what booteth it that you cite those dumpish fathers!
that saith Ἰ 'he Pmaclze? ἓ “Ι know that there is
nothing better than that a man should rejoiee in his
own works.'' W herefore‚ with Solomon, Ι say to my
doxy: “Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my
sponse: thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine
eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How beautiful are
thy breasts‚ my sister, my spouse. Thy bosom is fairer
than wine— '' and so forth.
By the Lord, courting the lasses is merry sport ἱ Α3
that Ode of Samuel the poet saith :—

“ Fail not, jolly cleric, merry maids amare,
Flattering busses knowing how to you praestare—
So contriving, many a day, youth's flower conservare i ”

 

“Amor is love, and God is love—therefore Amor is

not a bad thing !” Answer me that argument. And

Solomon saith: ‘⁶ If a man would give all the substance

of his house for love, it would utterly be eontemned.''
