LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

mutual amity when we abode at Deventer. But when
the freshman came hither, bearing with him your
treatise‚ he told me that you had said to him, “ Joa'ocus
now dwelleth at home, and he leadeth a merry life, and
thinketh no more of me.’' I answer that this is not
ἤ true. Ι am not a man of that kidney‚ but I well re-

,, member how you used to scribble on the wall at

De 1677167, “Out of sight, out of mind.’'
Yesterday‚pa1dy‚when we were at supper, and
were discussing some of those fish of my nativ e country,
called Amae, that my father had brought me, I yearned
for you to be there, and I cried“ Oh, if Magister Ο7 twin

and telling you how the fieshmen at Spcmdau had done
this vei se into Latin out of German—for m the v ulgai
tongue it iunneth thus: —

((16 11 ka am gen Spa da 111 auf den Damm,
Da schauten mich die plotzen an.''

And then you told me that you never knew before that
that sort of fish, roach to wit, went by the name of
αηιαε in Latin; and when I quoted the verse you
laughed consumedly—-and l went on to tell you that
fish like that were very plentiful with us, and that one
