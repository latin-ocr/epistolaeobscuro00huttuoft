LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

fish3 and between the courses we ceased not to drink
Kotzberger and Rhine wine, and beer of Ez‘mbeclc, and
ngau, and ,Naumburg; and the Magisters were full
pleased, and vowed that the new-fledged graduates had
acquitted themselves right well, and greatly to their
credit.

T hen began the Doctors over their cups to argue
canonically concerning profundities. And the question
arose, whether “magister nostrandus’' or “noster
magistrandus” is the fitter to denote a candidate
eligible for the degree of Doctor in Divinity. (As is
now, for example, the mellifluous Father leeodorie of
Gouda, friar of the Order of Carmelites, most reverend
legate of the benign University of Cologne——most
sagacious Artsman, Philosopher, and syllogiser-—and
withal Theologian pre-eminent.)

Forthwith made answer Magister W armsewmoel, my
compatriot—a right subtle Scotist, and a Master of
eighteen years' standing. (He was, in his time, twice
rejected and thrice impedited, for the Master's degree,
and yet he resided until, for the honour of the Univer-
sity, he was graduated.>

He knoweth his business right well, and hath many
pupils, high and low, young and old; and, speaking
with ripeness of knowledge, he held that we should say

“nostermagistr andus ⁹—in one wor——d because‘ ‘magis-
trare’' signifies to make Master, and‘ ‘baccalaurim-”e
to make Bachelor, and‘ ‘doctorare'’ to make Doct01
(whence come the technical terms ‘⁶ magistrand,” ‘⁶ bacca-
lauriand,’⁷ and “doctorand’'). Now Doctors in Divinity
are not styled “Doctors,⁷’ but on account of their
humility and sanctity, and by way of distinction, are
named and styled “Magistri Nostri,” because in the
Catholic Faith they stand in the room of our Lord
J esus Christ, who is the fount of life, and the ‘⁶ Magister ''
of us all: wherefore are they styled “Magistri Nostri ''
because it is for them to instruct us in the way of
truth—and God is truth.

Rightly‚ he argued, are they called “our masterS,''
for it is the bounden duty of us all, as Christians, to
hearken to their preachments, and no man may say

them nay—wherefore are they the masters of us all.
