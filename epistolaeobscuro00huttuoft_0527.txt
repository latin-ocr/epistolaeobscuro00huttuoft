EVEREND Herr Magister! Ι am vexed beyond
all vexation! Full well do I perceive that
saying of the poets to be true: “Misfortunes never
come singly”; and this Ι can prove as followeth: Ι am
in poor health, and besides my distemper there falleth
on me another heavy burden, namely this: Men flock
to me daily, and write to me from various provinces,
since I am known everywhere by reason of that tractate
you wot of, which I wrote against ιῙΟΙιαηπ Reuclzlz'n’s

Latin is intituled‚ ‘⁶ Dffensorz'um J ohannis Efeffi’ffi'orn

because I am in ill health. If he had consulted me I
should have told him that once was enough; for I am
sure we shall gain nothing by writing, for Reuclzlin is a
devil incarnate‚ and ever hitteth back. If, however,
the matter standeth thus, Ι desire earnestly that he
refrain. Y ou can hinder him as the corrector of his
books.
Secondly, I have heard somewhat over which Ι (10
