IN TRODUCTION

This blow was countered on August 12, by Arnold
von Tongern, Dean of the Faculty of Theology at
Cologne, in a book entitled Articuli sive Propose'tioues
de judaico 'sicvore nimis suspectae ece libello theutonico
,Ioanni-s· Rezcclclin—e'ae. the Augempiegel. This volume
contained a Carmen by Ortwin Gratius, and, strangely
enough, an Elogz'mn, by Hermann Buschius—so soon
to become an active foeman in the Reuchlinists' camp.

Of Arnold von Tongern we hear much in the
ensuing pages. His friends regarded him as a man
of high character and exceptionally pure life. His
foes painted him as something less than a man. In-
deed, Reuchlin himself, while still smarting under the
Articuli, declared that on Christ's behalf he would
gladly shed his blood so freely that “the timid, lily·
livered, and effeminate Arnold would not so much
as look upon it without turning pale as death and
falling in a swoon l '' ¹

Before the end of the year another yet more scur-
rilous pamphlet, under Pfefferkorn’s name, appeared;
this was the Brantspiegell, or Burning-glass.

Reuchlin’s reply to Arnold and his colleagues was
published in the spring of 1513. This was entitled
Defensio Joamzis Reuclzlz'n Plzorcensz's . . . contra
Calmmziatores suos colonienses. In this the exasperated
scholar turns to bay and slashes his assailants with
every weapon of learning, sarcasm, and vituperation
that he could lay his hands to.2 Some of his friends
thought him unwise. But Reuchlin realised by this
time the importance of the fray in which he was
involved, and the true nature of the foe with whom he
had to grapple. The Rabies leeologorum had broken
out in a most virulent form. The Dominicans were in—
furiated and in league against him. ‘⁶ No opposition‚”
writes Sir W. Hamilton, ‘⁴ had hitherto prevailed against
that powerful order, . . . whileacontemporary pope em-
phatically declared that he would rather provoke the
enmity of the most formidable sovereign than offend
even a single friar of those mendicant fraternities, who,
under the mantle of humility, reigned omnipotent over
