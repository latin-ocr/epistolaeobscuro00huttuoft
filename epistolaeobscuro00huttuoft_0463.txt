no heed to the mandate. Then the Rector inhibited the
undergraduates that they should not attend his lectures;
and then the fellow forced his way to the Rector and
said many insolent words to him, and thou'd him Ξ Then
the Rector sent for the University beadles, and essayed
to imprison him, because it was mightily scandalous that
a mere Student should ‘⁶ thou '' the Reotor of a Univer-
sity and a Doctor of Divinity: besides I hear that the
fellow is neither Bachelor nor Master‚ and is in no way
either qualified or giaduated, though he strutted about
like a warrior who was going to march to war, and he
wore a helmet, and a long knife by his side. Neverthe-
less, by the Lord‚ he would have been clapped in gaol if
he had not had friends in the city. Ι greatly grieve if it
be true that such a man as Magister Heclcman is dead,
for he did me many a good turn when I was at V z'esyzoza,
and so I have written an epitaph on him, as followeth :—

He who in this tomb doth lie
Was the Poets' enemy,

Minded aye to send them flying‚
When their craft they would be plying ἔ
One from out Bloravz’a came,
Who could no precedence claim,
Metre-spinning fain to teach,
And, his lawless end to reach,
leou’d the Rector to his face—-
Jail for him the proper place ἔ
Now that the good Rector's dead,
And in ll'ien is buri-ed,

Grudge not, of your charity,
Paternosters two or three.

A messenger hath brought us tidings which, if true,
are ill indeed—to wit, that your cause goeth amiss at
the Roman court. This I cannot believe, for these
messengers tell a pack of lies,

The Poets murmur sorely against you, and say that
they will defend Doctor Beuelclin with their verses,
But since you are likewise a poet—when you are so
minded—-I think you will easily get the better oi them.
Nev eitheless‚ prithee let me know how the business
goeth; and then, if I can aid §ou you will find 1n me
a faithful helpmate. Farew ell.

NUREMBERG.
