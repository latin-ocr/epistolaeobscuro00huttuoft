LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

take heed to his skin i He hath also written in Greek3
this is not well, for we are Latins and not Greeks. If
he would fain write what no man can understand, why
doth he not use Italian, or Bohemian, or Hungarian?
For then none could understand him. In the name of
a hundred devils let him conform to us Theologian&
and dispute in his writings with Utrum, and Contra,
and Arguitur, and Replica, and reach formal conclu-
sions, as all Theologians are wont to do, and then we
could read them.

I cannot tell you all now, nor describe the poverty
into which I have fallen. YVhen the Curialists see me
they call me Apostate‚ and declare that Ι have deserted
my Order, and they do the like to Doctor Peter DIeyw,
the Pastor, of Frsmlff'orn whom they harass as greatly
as myself‚ since he is of my part. N evertheless he is
better off than I, for he hath a good post, being Chap-

the Campo dei Fiom‘, and look out for Germans, whom
we would fain meet. But the Curialists come and
point at us with their fingers, and laugh, and say:
“There go the two who want to eat up Reuclelin!
They eat him and then void him again!’' And we
have such tribulations as might move a stone. Then
said the pastor: ‘⁶ Holy Mary 1 What doth it signify?
We must endure this for God’s sake. He suffered
many things for us, and we are Theologians who needs
must be lowly and despised in this world.” And thus
he maketh me of joyful heart once more, and, think I
to myself, “ Let them say what they will; yet they fail
of their desire.” If we were but back in the fatherland
and a fellow did such things, we should know what to
say and do to him, and Ι should have an easy task in
proceeding against him. Just now we happened to
be abroad together, behind two or three fellows who
walked in front, and I lighted upon a paper that, I
