11. 64] HERR VOLLWE IN

and mantles fit for the wives of knights. Sometimes
one of them holdeth three Canonries at one and the same
time, and putteth dues in his purse from all three;
whence he is able to enjoy many a drinking bout. And
yet he can stand in but one choir and not in the others.
So in some choirs there is no canon, and no substitute
to praise God and pray for the quick and the dead.
Can this be right? VVherefore are they not in-
quisitioned‚ and asked before a cloud of notaries and
witnesses—as of yore at suctim—⁶ What do you be-
lieve? Yes, or no? Do you believe, or do you not
believe? What is your belief concerning the sacra-
ments in the Church of God? Tell us, how many
are the Sacraments? What do you believe in your
heart concerning the Sacrament of the Eucharist?
Are the body and blood of Christ present in it? If
you believe this, why then after you have read mass-
if, forsooth, you read it once in the year—-do you go
home, and consort with a concubine who hath the
manners and aspect of a harlot, at the table or in your
chamber? Tell us if you believe the fruit of the mass
to be so great and so pleasing to God as that which
abideth in the Decretals and the Tractates of the
Theologians. VVherefore do ye hold so many benefices,
enough to maintain five or six devout priests, who
would joyfully read masses, and who with a willing
heart would preach to the people and the clergy‚ and
are able to give good counsel for the glory of God, the
salvation of souls, and the liberty of the Church—-who
would chide evil-doers, and beseech God for our Lord
the Pope, for the King, for the Bishops and other
Christian folk-——and offer that prayer for Peace and
Prosperity that in the Low Mass standeth after the
Sanctus and the Te igitur clementissime Pater? If
you believe that so much good proceedeth from the
Mass both to quick and dead, wherefore do you not
give to others of your superfluities‚ and hand them over
to other good, devout, and learned men—that God
might hence be exalted and the souls of the dead
might be the more speedily redeemed from the fires of
Purgatory3 and that the wrath of God against us
might be stayed, so that he might no longer afflict us
