1. 453-44] GALLUS LEIN E WE BER

perform than the other do-nothings——the quality's
lackeys, to wit. Ha, ha, ha! 1 must needs laugh—
else I am no true-born man—that you can ask so foolish
a question! Know you not that it is God's will to
make a man sick when he pleaseth, and to cure him
when he listeth? If sickness came by toil ’twould be
a bad thing for me; although you say Ι have little to
do. When of late Ι was at Heidelberg among boon-
compzmions, I was compelled to labour so mightily
with my throat, in the drinking of wine, that it would
have been no marvel had I stretched my gullet thereby
—and think you that no labour? But concerning that
matter let this suffice. There followeth in your letter
a request that I should procure for you a little book
in which is set forth somewhat useful for the young,
that you may use it for a primer. Since, therefore, I
have ever held you in esteem by reason of the various
branches of learning that you know by rote, I cannot
refrain from sending you a letter culled from a fair
volume intituled ‘⁶ lee Leipsie Blagisters' Clzaplet of
Letter8” which the most accomplished Magisters in
the benign University of Lec'psic have devised. This
I have done that, if this first letter please you, I may
send you the whole book—but I do not willingly let it
pass from my hands.
Here beginneth the aforesaid letter :—

INCE we have not met for a long while, it
seemeth good to me to send you a letter,
that our ancient friendship may not decay3 Ι have
heard from many that you still live, and are of
good health, and are all the man you were in your
youth: and this, by the Lord, I heard with vast
pleasure—God‚ who is good, will pardon me for so
round an oath. Would to God and Holy Mary
