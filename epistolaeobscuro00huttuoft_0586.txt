MARVEL greatly, reverend Herr Magister, that
my parents have sent me no money, though they
know that I have not a doit, and I have sent them
twenty letters at the least. If they will send me no
money, then, by the Lord, I have another plan in my
head. Mark my word, Ι have been minded of late to

or some spinaeh in Italian fashion. But well Ι know
how my brethren at home guzzle fish and fowl and all
manner of dainty dishes, and never give me a thought.
But Ι will endure it no longer. Prithee tell them so,
and then Ι will urge my master here to press forward
your suit as you would have me do.
Moreover, Ι pray you, when my parents hand over
the money, send it to me, and with it send me a pieoe
³ of chalk, for there is no good ohalk in Rome, if you
were to give a florin for it. And, as you know, one
must have chalk-—for I am a logician, and when I want
¹ to make syllogisms there is not always ink at hand.
Besides, it is irksome to make them with ink; send
