11. 28] BERNHARD GELFF

Sovereign Holiness Pope Leo, etc., utters blasphemy‚
and commits the crime of High Treason, in that he
calls the Pope “the hand-maid of the Lord,'' as though
he were a woman—as, indeed, we read that a woman
was once Pope—-for he saith (A. ii. 1), ‘⁶ And thus
your holiness as the Vicar of Christ on earth, and
‘ministram.'” There is also heresy contained in this
passage, for Pfeff'erkorn herein hints, not explicitly but
nevertheless implicitly, that the universal church hath
erred in making a woman a pope, which is the greatest
of errors. But whosoever saith that the Church errs is
necessarily a heretiC. Q. E. D.

I replgj, that J ohann Pfefferkorn, who is not a good
grammarian, and doth not understand Latin, thought
that ‘⁶ Papa ” was of the feminine gender, like “ Musa ”z
for he had heard from others that ‘⁶ nouns in α are of the
feminine gender, with exceptions ; ” as Alexander puts it :

“ Sit tibi nomen in a muliebre, sed excipe plura.’'

XVhence it is manifest that Johann Pfeff'erkorn in the

'present tractate writeth like a Theologian, and Theo-

logians pay no heed to grammar, for they belong to
another Faculty.

ARTICLE ΙΙ.

The Reuclzlz'nists angue .· Johann Pfefferkorn in
many places, as for instance (A. i.) and (K. iv.), when
he wishes to swear that something is true, says “ medius·
fidius,” as though he should say ‘⁶ by my god Fidius.”
For “mediusfidius” is by interpretation ‘⁶ meus deus
fidius :’' whence it is manifest that J ohann Pfefferkorn
himself is an idolater, and hath for his Lord, not Christ,
but Fidius, which was an idol among the pagans of old.

I replgs, that Pfefferkorn in making oath ‘⁶ medius-
fidius ’' did not think of this word “ fidius ”—which may
be the name of some idol or other—but he used the term
adverbially. And Donatus puts it thus, who is autho—
ritative and is read in the schools, that ‘⁶ mediusfidius ’⁹
means ‘⁶ assuredly ’' or ‘⁶ truly.” Again, we may allege,
as before, that Johann Pfefferkorn pays no heed to
grammar: or again, that “ mediusfidius ” means ‘⁶ by
my faith,” as I heard from a Humanist.
