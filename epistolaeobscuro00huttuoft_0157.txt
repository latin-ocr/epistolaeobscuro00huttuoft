HIPP

S. D. M. Ortvz‘no Gratio

‘⁶ AETAMIN I in domino et exultate iusti, et gloria-

mini omnes recti corde,” Psalm. xxxi.

Sed ne

habeatis molestiam dicentes: ‘⁶ quid putat iste cum sua
allegatione ?’' debetis legere unam novitatem cum lae-
titia, quia hilarabit vestram dominationem mirabiliter;

et volo scribere cum brevibus verbis.

Fuit hic unus

poeta qui vocatur Ioannes Aesticampianus‚ et ipse fuit

satis praetensus, et parvipendit saepe magistros artium,
et annihilavit eos in sua lectione, et dixit quod non sunt

sufficientes, et quod unus poeta valet decem magistros,
et quod poetae in processione deberent praecedere

magistros et licentiatos.

⁹ Aesticampianus: J oannes Rhagius
Aesticampianus (1460-1520), the
Latinised name of Johann Rack, of
Sommerfeld. Visiting Italy in his
youth, he entered the ranks of the
Humanists, and on recrossing the
Alps he proceeded to Paris, He is
next heard of successively at Frei-
burg—im-Breisgau‚ Cologne, cracow,
andFrankfort-on-the-(⁷)der—wherehe
reckoned Ulrich von Hutten among
his pupils. For three years, 1507—10,
he lectured publicly at Leipsic on
Pliny, Plautus, and other classica]
authors. The barbarians of Leipsic,

however—as Fabricius puts it—could
not brook the Humanities, and
Rhagius was driven out, not without
a parting bolt in the shape of a fiery
oration: ‘¹ You have overthrown
Aesticampianus‚'’ he eried, “after
assailing him with every kind of
weapon. What Humanists will visit
you in the future? Not one, by
Hercules, not one! You will live
out your sordid lives, uncivilised and
conte'mned—danmati omnes immorie-
mmz.

After teaching the Classics for
three years at Freiburg (see ii. 9),
A. was attracted to Wittenberg· by
the offer of a handsome stipend from
Frederick, Duke of Saxony, and
there resided until his death.

“Virum doctrina et moribus in-
signem,'' wrote H. Cornelius Agrippa
of A. in 1533, and Luther addresses
him as “virorum eruditissime et in-
tegerrime.’' Among A.¹s literary
labours are an edition of the Pinax
of Cebes, a Modus epistolandi, Epi-
grams, and prefaces to, or com-
mentar-ies on, sundry works of Pliny,
Plautus, and Cicero (see J. A.
