11. 54] WILHELM BRIKOT

“I am ready to oppose myself to this monk's fury.”
Then Doctor van Hoogstraten openly threatened him,
saying‚‘ ‘I will make you repent ev er having said one
word on Reueltlin's behalfss’ And I heard him declare,
with his own lips, at the ti1ne‚ that when he had
obtained judgment against Benclclin he would instantly
proceed against Doctor von der Wielf, and denounce
him as a heretic, inasmuch as he had collected certain
heretical propositions out of his words. But now all
is changed! Believe me, the business fareth but ill—-
and you may now find anywhere ten upholders of
Rem-lilia and not one of the TheologianS.

Moreover upon a division after a disputation by
Theologians, eighteen were found to vote for Reuclzlin,
and only seven sor his accusers: nay, even those seven
did not declare that the Augenspiegel ought to be
burned, but spake with limitations.

Therefore Ι can hold out but little hope. You
must do all in your power to bring about Jolcann
von der I‘Vz'cffs death, for he it is that is the cause
of Reuclzlae'n's asoendency, and the Theologians’ decline.
Had it not been for him such things would never have
ha ened.

p{nd now Ι trow Ι have acquitted myself so well
in letter-writing‚ that never again will you have grounds
for vituperating me. And so, farewell.

From the Coum* oF Rome.
