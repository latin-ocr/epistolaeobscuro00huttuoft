Ulrich was born in 1488, at his father's castle of
Steckelberg in Hesse-Nassau, not far from Fulda with
its famous Benedictine abbey. So puny and sickly
did the child appear, that his father resolved to make
a monk of him—although the first-born son—and sent
him at the age of eleven to Fulda, to be educated
under its stern abbot, and ultimately to take the
monastic VOWS. Ulrieh remained at Fulda for six years
—a diligent student, it seems, who made good use of
the means of learning there available—-and then, in
the summer of 1505, almost on the day when Luther
voluntarily entered the convent at Erfurt—he ran
away. Crotus Rubianus, as we have mentioned, is
credited with having planned the lad’s escape, and
before the year was out the two friends made their
appearance as fellow-undergraduates at Cologne, It
must be added that Ulrich’s father, an austere man—
whom to-day we may venture to call pig-headed—
seems to have cast off his erring son without further
inquiry, and left the sensitive, delicate, and brilliant
boy to the far from tender mercies of a turbulent
world. In less than a year the two friends tired of the
uncongenial surroundings of friar-ridden Cologne, and
betook themselves to Erfurt. There they found
Mutian and Eoban Hesse—a nucleus to which they
were speedily attracted. But it was impossible for the
adventurous Hutten to cast anchor for long, however
pleasant the harbour; “my home is everywhere,” he
said—‘⁶ in Germany” he should have added; for the
key to much that is contradictory in Hutten’s check-
ered career is his lofty patriotism, his burning desire to
see Germany a nation, his determination, in particular,
to cast off the temporal power of Rome, even if this
should involve the severance of not a few spiritual
bonds.
