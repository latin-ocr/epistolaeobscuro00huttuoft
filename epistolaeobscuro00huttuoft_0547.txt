One in logie is versed‚ another in poetry skilleth,

Natural Philosophy one aequireth, leechcraft another,

W hile yet another, through grace, hath competent learn-

Thou the exemplar of such, who a peel· doth hardly
acknowledge

At Cologne—or at Rome, in all the ranks of the Rota-—

Rome, where folk at the Court contend like so many
freshmen,

Brangling and wrangling at law, with an eye to possible

Who, with their quillets and quirks and screeds= of flimsy

Forgive me if there are faults in these verses, for,
as saith the Philosopher‚ ‘⁶ To err is human.’' Prithee,
send me some news.
