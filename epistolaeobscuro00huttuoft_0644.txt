LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

honour, and mightily loved it. And now I would have
you know that this beast is dead. When it was ill
the Pope fell into great grief, and he summoned a host
of physicians, and said, ‘⁶ If it be possible, cure Elephant
for me.'⁷ Thereupon they bestirred themselves, and cast
its water, and gave it a cathartic that eost five hundred
golden crowns—-yet were not the bowels of Eleplccmt
moved thereby, and so it died. Sorely doth the Pope
grieve for Eleplccmt, for whom, they say, he gave a
thousand ducats.

In sooth it was a marvellous brute, and it had 3
great abundanee of long snout3 and when it saw the
Pope it would kneel to him, and cry in a terrible voice,

The rumour goes that the King of Franco> and King
Clearles have made a treaty of peace for many years,
and have exchanged oaths. But some think this peace

parsonage, and spend happy days. There shall I keep
fiocks of geese and hens and ducks, and Ι shall have in
my byre five or six cows to yield me milk for the
making of cheese and butter. And Ι shall keep a cook
who can turn her hand to such work. She must be of
ripe years, for if she were young she might sorely
tempt me, and I might fall into sin. She will spin for
me, and Ι will buy the fiax for her. I shall keep two or

bacon. Before all things I shall keep in my house
great store of victuals. Once a year Ι shall kill an ox
and sell half to the country-folk, and eure the rest in
the reek. And behind the house there is a garden
where Ι 311311 sow garlic, and onions and parsley—with
pot-herbs, turnips, and the like. Then in the winter I
shall sit in my chamber and study how to hold forth to
my floek, out of the Paratus, or the Simple Sermons,
or even out of the Bible‚ so that I may become
