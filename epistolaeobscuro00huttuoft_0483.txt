S I have ofttimes told you, I chafe bitterly because ·
that vile raff, to wit the F aculty of Poets, groweth

and extendeth throughout every province and region. 1

111 1111Υ time there was only one poet—and his name was
Samuel—but now in 3 single burg 3 good 56016 may be
found, to 1131355 115 who cling to the ancients. Just now
I sharply snihbed one who said that ‘⁶ scholaris '' did not
mean 3 person who went to school to learn, for, quoth
I, ‘⁴ Thou 355 1 &Vouldst thou correct the H oly Doctor
who 1156111 11131 word ἶῑ ” But forthwith 116 wrote a
lampoon against 1116, with many 5611111111165 111616111, and
Vowed that l was 110 sound grammarian, in 11131 l had
not rightly expounded certain words when l treated of
Alexander, his F irst Part, and of the book De modis
Signg'ficandi.

words, that you may see that Ι have rightly expounded
them according to all the vocabularieS, and Ι 6311 111016-
