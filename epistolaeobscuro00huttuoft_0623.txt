11. 39] KONRAD STRILDRIOT

Moreover there is here a Theologian——as he calleth
himself, but Ι should rather call him a Poet—Erasmus
of Rotterdam by name, who is reverenced by many as
if he were one of the wonders of the world. He it is
who wrote the Book of Proverbs that you once shewed
me at Cologne, saying, “What do we want with the
Proverbs of Erasmus when we have the Proverbs of
Solomon? ” This Erasmus holdeth firmly by Reuchlin,
and is for ever praising him3 and lately he printed
certain Letters which he sent to the Court of Rome,
addressed to the Pope and some of the Cardinals.
In these he lauded Reuclclin and slandered the theo-
logianS. When Ι saw them Ι cried, ‘⁶ If the Magister-
nosters do but cast their eyes on this, the Devil will
nab him 1⁹³

It happeneth therefore that our University‚ which
highly regardeth Erasmus, leaneth towards Reuclzlz'n.
The Poet Glareanus, moreover, hath come hither—a
very headstrong man, as you know—and he uttereth
outrageous calumnies against you and other Theologians.
He declareth that he is going to write a book about the
iniquities of the Dominicans‚ and will relate from be-
ginning to end all the doings that took place at Berne.
I would gladly beg him, in friendly wise, to refrain
from this, but he is a terrible man, and a chola-ic, for
ever threatening buffets—and he must be possessed of a
devil. I trust that judgment in favour of the Theo-
logians will soon issue from Rome—and then all will
go well. But, if it should prove in favour of Reuehlz'n,
then the Devil will hold the candle ! Farewell.
