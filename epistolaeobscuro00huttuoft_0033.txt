INTRODUCTION

of an effete philosophy The growing enthusiasm
aroused by the teachings of the German humanists
spread envy and even dismay among the patrons
of scholasticism· , the degrees conferred by German
universities were despised—it became a point of honour
among young and ambitious scholars not to graduate;
this touched professorial purses, for the hostels, or
boarding-houses, from which many dons of the day
were wont to reap a rich harvest, began to be de-

Cologne itself. Scholar after scholar they thwarted,
bullied‚ and drove from their gates. Caesarius, J oannes
and Serratius Aedicollius, Murmellius, and Hermannus
Buschius were in turn branded as corrupters of youth,
and expelled with contumely——the last named, how-
ever, returning thrice to the attack‚ and living to
see the principles he had championed triumphant in
the end.

All these skirmishes, however, were but preliminary,
or accessory, to the great conflict. The issues of the
