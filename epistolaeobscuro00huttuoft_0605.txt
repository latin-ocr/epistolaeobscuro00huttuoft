of not rightly administering justice, and deserves to go
thrice to the stake as a heretic.

I replgy .· Pfefferkorn does not say that the Pope or
the Curia issued that Commission unjustly, but means
that Reuchlin obtained it unjustly. Therefore it is
Johann Reuchlin and not the Pope whom he calleth
unJust.

ARTICLE X.

Tlce Reuclelc'nist objects .· Pfefferkorn once again com-
mits the crime of High Treason, in that he lies mani-
festly concerning the Emperor and the Bishop of
Cologne. For he alleges that a certain Inquisitor of
Heretical Pravity, by the authority of His Majesty,
and with the approval of the Bishop of Cologne, burnt
the Augeaspiegel at Cologne. This is utterly false.
For neither did his Majesty authorise this, nor did the
Bishop of Cologne approve of it: for if the Emperor had
authorized this, he would not have laboured in Reueh-
lin's behalf by writing to the Pope, and desiring him to
defend his Counsellor against the envy and craft of the
Theologians. Therefore Pfefferkorn is plainly a forger,
for he forges, or contrives, Imperial Commissions.

I reply, that it matters not about the Bishop of
Cologne, for he is dead. But, as to the Emperor,
Johann Pfeff’erkorn speaks deliberately with regard to
what was implicitly the Emperor's intention. For at
the first, when Pfefferkorn took up this laudable work
in the Cause of the Faith, to wit, the condemnation
of all Jewish books to the flames, the Emperor was
minded, as it seemed‚ to burn all books that are con-
trary to the Christian faith. But Johann Reuchlin’s
book is one of these: therefore the Emperor was
minded to burn that also. Hence Pfefferkorn declares
what the Emperor intended—but implicstly, not ex-
plicitly and expressly. And he deems it to suffice that
the Emperor once for all gave him authorization to
deal with Jewish books, with which heretical books
may be also included. For Ι have heard that if the
Emperor had adhered to that laudable proposal, the
Theologians would have made a visitation of all the
libraries throughout Germany, and would have burnt
