LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

van IIoogstraten cannot plead poverty‚ seeing that he is
one of a mendicant Order, who are all manifestly poor.
If it were not that I fear excommunication, I would say
that the Pope erred on this point. Moreover I do not
believe it to be true that Magister Jalcob dispensed
money in that fashion, or bestowed gists, because he is
a mighty zealous man; and it is my belief that those
,Iurists and the rest concoct this gossip‚ and that Doctor
Reuchlm knoweth how to wheedle them, for Ι have heard
that many burgS‚ and princes, and persons of quality
have written letters on his behalf.

Now the reason of this is that they are not grounded
in Theology‚and do not understand howthe case standeth
——otherwise they would bid the devil take that heretic—
for a heretic he is, though the whole world should hold
the contrary. You must forthwith explain matters to
the Magisters at Cologue, that they may take counsel.
Write and tell me what they intend to do. Farewell in

Christ.

{ntimate with J olzann Psk’ffie? l 07 η’ ς wife. He declared
his to be tine, and made oath‚ and Ι believe him. For
you are a squire of dames, and know ‚how to wheedle
them—besides, you have. Ovidxv..f.‘A1-t.of Lovessl. hy

’ lotel A certain merchant did tell me, too, that Magister

Aonold zon 'l ungena was in the lady' s good giaces as
well. But this is false, for Ι know of a truth that he is
a virgin, and hath never bussed a wench. But even if
he had done, or were to do, what Ι cannot believe of
