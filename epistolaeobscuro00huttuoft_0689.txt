(I BROTHER NOLLERIUS STECH of
Calabria to sslagi-s‘ter Orth'n Gratius·

Y devout prayers Ι desire you, by way of greeting.

Your Theological Excellency knoweth that I am

as it were a pilgrim from Mount Sinai—but you know

not of the ills that Ι have suffered since Ι departed from

you at Cologne. Though it would be tedious to tell

you all, yet have I no other friend remaining to me to
whom Ι may pour forth my woes, save you.

'When I open my lips in the monastery they forth-
with cry, “A pretty monk art thou, who desirest to
lead an easy life!'' As for the ungodly, it is not so
with them. I cannot guess what may be the root of it
all, unless it be the ill-fortune of Doctor Jalcob van
Hoogstraten in consuming so large a sum of money in
the Roman Curia on behalf of the Christian Faith that
Johann Reuclzlz'n the worthless hath overthrown in his
⁴alugenspiegel. All our monasteries, Ι trow, ought to
send him money, for he must needs be liberal and give
bribes at large to the Cardinals, that they may give
judgment in his favour, and not for «ῙοΙιαηηγ ΕειισΙιῖὶη.
Hence it cometh that the Superiors abate our wine,
notwithstanding that Solomon saith in Proverbs xii. 1,
‘⁶ Song, woman, and wine rejoice the heart of man!''
As for song, Ι 3111 for ever at it—chanting and howling
Psalms in the Choir, so that it hath neither grown rare
nor precious. Concerning women, it is a grief for me
to speak, for Ι never see any, save when Ι go to market
with our steward to buy eggs. Even when I go to the
villages round about to collect turnips and greens, and
the flesh assaileth me with a wench hard by, she will
have naught to do with me. Now therefore that our
wine is minished‚ what solace is left us? would that
we had but one half of the comforts of life enjoyed by
other orders—or by the priests with us who are vowed
to the Holy Ghost. With this order, Ι think, you are
well acquainted3 they wear a double white cross on
