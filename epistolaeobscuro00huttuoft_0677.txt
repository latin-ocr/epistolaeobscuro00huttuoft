their sanctity, and mightily useful: the Church's only
pillars are the monks.'' Then quoth he, “I divide
monks into three classes. The first are holy and useful,
but they are in heaven. The second are neither pro-
fitable nor wholly useless—you will see them painted
in the churcheS. The third are still alive, and they are
mightily noxious and are by no means saints. They
are as vain-glorious as any laymen. They take delight
in storing up wealth and having fair ladies around
them. Not long ago I was at Heidelbeoug; now there
liveth near Heidelberg· a great Abbot-——a fat, surly
rascal—and he drove out all the monks from St.
J acob's College, saying that he would brew fine broth
for them, and naught beside. But they said that
they believed that he acted thus—the good brother 2-
because the Count Palatine was about to introduce
new methods‚ and that a Poet was coming to Heidel-
berg who would make the monks and other students
talk the new-fangled Latin. And so the fat Abbot
quickly perceived what the event of the jest would be 3
and, quoth he, ‘My monks must not learn the new
Latin, for then they would grow proud of knowing
more than I, and I should cut a fine figure among
them—like an oversed jackass in a rout of monkeys ! ’ ”

But of a truth this argument seemeth irregular‚ for
it lacketh a pair of premises and therefore reacheth no
conclusion.

I send you Paul’s book, which you ought to have
printed, for it containeth a store of good things in
opposition to leplzeling who assaileth the monks;
but he will change his tune when he readeth that
Christ was a monk—an Abbot, to wit—and St. Peter a
prior, and Judas Iscariot a cellarer‚ and Philip a porter,
and so of the rest according to sub et supra; all of
which this illuminated and learned monk Paul Lang
so masterly proveth, that quvlaeling and his dis-
ciples cannot open their lips against him. Yet a fautor
of IVimplzelz'ng'S withstood me to my face, and swore
that the monks lied like so many scurvy tapsters
who would fain make out that Christ was therefore a
portentous animal—a cowled beast! And they cried
out against me in His name. T hen was Ι sore afraid,
