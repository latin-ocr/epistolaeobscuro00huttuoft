LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

enough what solloweth, and it would be uncivil for me
to openly prove them to be heretics. Oh, if they but
knew the subtlety that Ι possess they would not shew
themselves before my face. But keep silence till the
end, and then it will be perceived in what key the tune
oeth.

g No longer can Ι put off telling you the news.
Lately, Ι know not when, Ι sat at a feast, and there
