LETTERS OF OBSCU-RE MEN

burnt, inasmuch as he deemed it impossible that Doctor
Reuchlz'n could devise any quibble to prevent that being
done. But a fellow here, a Poet by repute, went about
uttering foul words against the aforesaid Doctor of
Divinity, and when he met him glared at him with snaky
and venomous eyes ς and he cried openly, ‘⁶ That preacher
is not worthy to sit at the same table with honest men;
and Ι can prove that he is a vile poltroon, for in the pulpit
of your church, before all the congregation, he lied against
the good report of an illustrious man, and said that
which is not.” Then he cried, “Out of envy do they
torment the good Doctor l '' And he called Decimarz'us
a beast and a dog, and swore that no heretic was ever
so malicious and envious. Now this saying came to the
ears of the preacher‚ and he excused himself—-sufficiently
as it seemeth to me—saying that although the book had
not been burnt, perhaps nevertheless it would be burnt

ι later on; moreover he quoted Scripture in many places

to prove that nothing any one may say in defence of the

N Catholic Faith is a lie. He declared, moreover, that the

bailiffs and officers of the Bishop of Mm'nz had hindered
the execution of the sentence, contrary to all justice, but
that folk would see what would happen yet, for he would
venture a prophecy that the book would be burnt, though
the Emperor, and the Ising ofFrance, and every Prince
and Duke maintained Doctor Re'nclzlin's· cause. Ι deem
it well to inform you of these things, that you may be
forewarned—and I beg of you to walk warily in all your
ways, lest you incur reproach. And so, farewell.
