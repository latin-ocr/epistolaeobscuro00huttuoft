INTRODUCTION

of egregious dolts: it declared, too, that many of the
monks and friars who professed to be not as other men,
but able to set at defiance primitive instincts of a
healthy animal, were not only very human in their
frailties, but, if the truth be said, a trifle swinish l And
the worst part of it was that people had come to believe
that there was some truth in the indictment.

The temporal benefits that monasticism had con-
ferred upon mankind were forgotten-—or rather, to folk
of those days were practically unknown. How monks
and friars, heedless of discouragement and persecution‚
had kept alive the feeble sparks of literature and art
when they seemed well-nigh perishing in the darkness
of barbarism—how they had turned barren marshes
into fertile tracts, and made devastated valleys once
more laugh and sing with rustling corn—how they had
fed thehungry and ministered to the sick-—all these
good works, and many more, of the pious men of old
were forgotten. Can we wonder? The sordid lives of
their debased successors in the sixteenth century veiled
the vision of a glorious past. Successors, but—let us
always bear in mind—not descendants, In that dis-
tinction lies the key to the failure of monasticism.
The stupendous folly of celibacy had met with its
inevitable doom. Year after year, generation after
generation‚ century after century, the Church had
lured thousands and tens of thousands of the keenest
intellects‚ the most sympathetic—ay, and the bravest
hearts into the cloister‚ and condemned them to sterile
extinction. In ignorance, or defiance‚ of the laws of
heredity, the devisers of monastic rules seem to have
deliberately aimed at leaving to the unfittest of each
generation obedience to the first recorded divine com-
mand to man: ‘⁶ Be fruitful and multiply‚ and replenish
the earth.'' But Nature's laws cannot be abrogated even
by a saintly veto. Slowly, but irresisfflbly, degeneracy in
the classes from which the monasteries were chiefly
recruited showed itself reflected within their walls, till
drunken dullards reeled in cloisters that large-hearted
enthusiasts had once paced. The place of ascetics ever
struggling to keep the old Adam in check by fasting,
flagellation, and phlebotomy‚ was taken by monkish
