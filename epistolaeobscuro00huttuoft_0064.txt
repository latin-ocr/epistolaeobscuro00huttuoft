it first appeared, was no less keen may be safely infel red
,- there 1s a story, which may be traced back to Simler’s
Life of Balling ων, that when he first read a copy lent
him by a friend, ‘he fell into such a fit of laughing
that an abscess' 1n his face burst, which else should have
been laid open by older of his physicianff' ‘This
ought to be reckoned for one of the benefits produced
‚ by 16ἓιεὶίῐ1ἑὲςξ3 is Bayle' 3 characteristic comment.
Assuming this tradition to have a foundation in
fact, it seems likely that it was the first or second
edition that fell into Erasmus' 3 hands, for in the Ap-
pendix to the third edition he is himself introduced by
name, and, though the allusion is respectful enough,
there is good reason to think that the sensitive scholar
demurred to being depicted dans cette galera). We
need not suppose that Erasmus had grown prim and
prudish : but he had become a very notable man in the
eyes of the world. He knew that great events were
imminent, and he felt some doubt as to the part he
would be found playing in them. It seemed scarcely
prudent to commit himself unreservedly to a party who
expressed their opinions with such heedless exuberance.
We have touched lightly in the preface on the
exaggerated accusation brought by a certain school
of writers against the Epistola& founded on the un-
deniable fact that they are not seldom indecorous in
expression. We do not propose to magnify the im-
portance of the charge by dilating upon it. The occa-
sional grossness is perfectly innocuous‚ and the manners
of the times would furnish ample excuse for its pre-
sence. After all, with respect to coarseness of situation
and language, the authors of the Epistola& as Professor
Saintsbury has remarked,c ‘do not come near the com-
mon indulgence of the fifteenth century in most coun-
tries, or the recrudescence of the same thing in the
mouths of the Refor1ne1·s.⁷’1 The question, of course, is
merely one of taste and not of morality‚ but it may be
observed that it is one thing to foist stupid indecencies
into a great work in order to tickle the ears of the
groundlings—as did Rabelais‚ probably, and the Eliza-
bethan d1·amatistS‚ certainly—and quite another thing,
