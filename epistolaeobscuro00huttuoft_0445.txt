1. 6] NIKOLAUS ZIEG ENMELKER

Be pleased to salute, on my behalf, Magister Remi-
gius, for he was formerly my class-master, and ofttimes
would chide me roundly, saying: “You are a goose,
and will not study how to become a good disputant.'’
And 1 would say: ‘⁶ Most excellent Herr Magister, I
will do better in future.” And then he would some-
times send me away, and sometimes give me sound
chastisement: in those days Ι was so submissive that Ι
would willingly endure correction for my faults.

,, And now l have no more to write, save that I hope
{you will live for a hundred years, Fare thee well in
⁴ peace.

to sslagister Ort-(cin Gratius

ΑΒΗΝΒΑΝΤ greetings‚ with mighty respect to your
worthiness, as is but meet in addressing your
magistrality.

Reverend Herr Magister, you must know that there ’ἱ
is a notable question that Ι desire, or entreat, to be by ξ
you magistr-ally determined. ⁴

There is a certain Greeian here who readeth in
Urbmz’s Gmmmar, and Whenever he writeth Greek he
always putteth tittles atop.

Thereupon Ι said, a little while ago, ‘⁶ Magister
Ortwin of Deventer also handleth Greek Grammar,
and he is as well qualified therein as that fellow, and
yet he never maketh tittles so: and Ι trow he knoweth
his business as well as that Grecian—-ay, and can put
him to rights.'' Nevertheless some distrusted me in
this matter, wherefore my friends and fellow-students
besought me to write to your worthiness so that you
might make it known to me whether we ought to put
tittles or no. And if we ought not to put them, then,
by the Lord‚ we will roundly harry that Greeian‚ and
bring it to pass that his hearers shall be but few !

Of a truth Ι took note of you at Cologne, in Hein-
rich chentell’s house, when you were reader, and had to
correct Greek, that you would strike out all the tittles
