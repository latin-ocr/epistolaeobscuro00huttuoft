naught but belabour the Regulars. I warn him, pardy,
that if he refrain not his hands from them we will do
to him as to Rcuclzlin, though he were in a hundred
ways favoured by the Pope and King Clzarlcs. We
have seen many men as arrogant as he, and yet we
have suppressed them.

I will tell you somewhat-—but blab not thereos, or
the devil may confound me. Doetor Jacob vem Hoog-
straten and all the Doctors in Colognc and Cambridge are
now examining his commentary on Jcromc, and Ι 11631·
it will go woundily hard with him. I would not stand
in his shoes for a hundred florins, for they say that he
