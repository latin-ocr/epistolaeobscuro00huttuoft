LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

But enough of this3 let us turn to other matters,

You bid me send you some news—so you must know
that there were high jinks here in Lent. There were
joustings, and the Prinoe himself rode in the Platz, and
he had a fine horse, and a fine saddle-oloth too, upon
which was painted a woman in brave attire‚ and near her
sitting a youth, with curly looks, who played 1111 organ
to her, as saith the Realmist .· “ Young men and 111111ᾶ6115,
old men and children, praise the name of the Lord.''
And when the Prince had entered the town, the Univer-
sity enthroned him with great pomp, and the burghers
brewed lashings of beer, and set forth toothsome fare,
and royally feasted the Prinoe and all his train. And
afterwards they fell to danoing, and Ι 510οᾶ 011 11 seaffold
to look on. l 61111 61111 10 remembranoe nothing else,
save that I wish yon all good wishes. So fare ye well,
in the name of the Lord.
