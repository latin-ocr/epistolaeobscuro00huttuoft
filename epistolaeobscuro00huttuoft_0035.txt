IN TRODUCTION

Jews should be broken, the writer urges, by their
being compelled to attend sermons and to relinquish
usury, but especially by the destruction of their books
—those founts of heresy and blasphemy. Let them
keep their Bible, and nothing else.

N ext year, 1508, there appeared ‘⁶ The Jews' Con-
fession,”1 ostensibly by the same author, and of this
no less than six editions, in Latin and High and Low
German, were published in twelve months. The object
of this tract was to ridicule various Jewish rites. On
the Day of Atonement‚ we are told, the Jews whirl
white cocks and hens round their heads, crying, ‘⁶ I am
released from my sins! Thou goest to thy death, and
I to eternal life Ξ ” VVhereupon they kill and eat these
subsffitutes for the scapegoat. Axt other thnes they
purge their offences by shaking their garments over
running water in which there are fishes—or, failing
this, they wait for a high wind to blow away their sins
like dust.

At the beginning of 1509 two other pamphlets‚
each in German and Latin garb, issued from the same
prolific source. One deals with the Paschal Feast, and
in the other, ‘⁶ The Jews’ Enemy‚”2 it is pointed out
that Jews become physicians merely to facilitate the
murder of Christians: the author is, however, liberal-
nnnded enough to adnut that then enqssoynunst as
scavengers might be unobjectionable.

It is worthy of note that the latter tract contained
an anti-Semitic epigram by Ortuinus Gratius, who had
become a prominent member of the Faculty of Arts at
Colo ne.

Ιὲ was, therefore, soon after the publication of “ The
J ews’ Enemy ’' that Pfefferkorn sought an audience of
the emperor. Maximilian, though good-natured and
impulsive, had just then much to occupy his thoughts,
and it is improbable that the uncouth visitor would
have' gained access to the imperial presence, had he
not been influentially backed. But Pfefferkorn⁷s cre-
dentials were unimpeachable.
