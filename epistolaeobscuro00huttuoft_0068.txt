regarded merely as a work of literary art is in no way
concerned with such moral blots. Even the most
atrocious libel may possess eminent graces of literary
form: how few readers who to-day take up the Letters
of szius to enjoy their vituperative eloquence care a
straw about their truth and justice. And there is no
lack of truth and justice here.

The Epistolae were not allowed to pass unanswered.
In the summer of 1516 there appeared “Johann
Pfefferkorn's Defence against the Slanderous and
Calumnious Letters of Obscure Men.” This pro-
duction—interesting historically, but worthless from a
literary point of view—professes to review the whole
situation. Testimonials from universities alternate with
plaintive excuses or passionate recriminations, and the
winged words of the satire are ineffectually thrown
back in the face of the satirist.

The issue of this forcible-feeble rejoinder—of
course by Ortwin—was most ill-judged. Had the
theologians taken their first correction mildly they
might have escaped further chastisement: as it turned
out, they did but prepare a fresh scourge for their own
backS.

Early in 1517 a new series of Letters from the
Obscure Men, sixty-two in number, made their ap-
pearance. In many of these “The Defence” is
pounced upon as a foundation for fresh gibes : Ortwin's
Latin phrases are for ever turning up in some ridiculous
context—his earnest protestations are ludicrously mis-
understood—his excuses meet with their usual fate of
being twisted into confessions. In brilliancy of humour
and keenness of satire the new Letters as a whole were
not a whit behind their predecessorS.

'We have no record of Leo the Tenth's private
opinion with regard to the Epistolae. His literary
taste was cultivated and comprehensive. In his
official capacity, however, he deemed it advisable to
issue a bull, dated March 15, 1517, which is a very
characteristic specimen of papal fulminations: “It
hath come to our knowledge,” Leo is made to say,
“to the grievous distress of our mind, that certain
