LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

take the field are guilty of the sin of Pride only in so
far that they do these things unjustly to the injury of
others, But when the Emperor and the Pope wage
war, it is to be assumed that they do so in defence of
the Church and the Empire, and therefore Pfeff'erkorn’s
censure doth not apply to them.

ARTICLE VIII.

The Reuelclinz‘st objecta: Pfefferkorn accuseth the
Emperor of falsehood, for he uses these words, (O. ii.
col. i.>, against Reuchlin, “I accuse him of being a
betrayer of God and man and of his Imperial Majesty
a faithless Counsellor.'’ In these words he flatly con-
tradicts the Emperor, and calls him a liar. For his
Majesty the Emperor, in his Letter to the Pope,
and in many mandates and commissions calls Johann
Reuchlin his faithful counsellor and adviser. What
greater slander can he utter than to call him a liar?
Hence he is irremissibly deserving of the penalty of
High Treason.

I reply, that this passage distinguishes, and should
be punctuated with a comma after the word ‘⁶ Majesty.”
For Reuchlin is perchance a faithful counsellor of the
Emperor in his affairs, but not faithful to Johann
Pfefferkorn‚ as he has shewn by many proofs. And
hence no man can suppose that Johann Pfefferkorn
speaks against the Emperor, seeing that he is a good
imperialist, as his writings everywhere show, whether
German or Latin.

ARTICLE IX.

lee Reachlz'nist objecta: that the chiefest and
greatest, and most terrible, and most horrible, and
most diabolical, and infernal charge of all is that
Johann Pfefferkorn blames both the Pope and the
Curia by accusing them of the sin of deceit. For he
writes, (Ι. iv.), ‘⁶ But all these matters, his commission
obtained, not justly, but with the greatest injustice‚
from Rome, the Master of Heretical Pravity heeded
not, etc.” Now it was the Pope who gave that com-
mission ; therefore J ohann Pfeff'erkorn accuses the Pope
