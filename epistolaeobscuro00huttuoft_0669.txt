me. You tell me that the Cause of the Faith fareth
ill at Rome. Gadzookers! what can we say? Those
Jurists and Poets will overthrow the whole faculty of
the Artists and Theologians; for even here, in our Uni-
versity‚ they would fain brow-beat the Magisters and
the Divines. A fellow here claimed of late that a
Bachelor of Law should take precedence of a Master
of Arts. Then quoth Ι, “That is impossible. Ι can
prove that Masters of Arts rank higher than Doctors
of Law. Doctors of Law are learned in one science
only—namely Jurisprudence ; but Magisters are Masters
of the Seven Liberal Arts‚ and therefore are the more
learned. “ Go to Itahqss’ said he, “and tell them that
you are a Magister of Lez'psic, and see how they will
bait you 1³⁹ But I made answer that Ι could defend my
Mastership as well as any that cometh out of Ι taly. And
so I departed‚ thinking within myself that our faculty
is sorely maligned, and this is a crying shame. For it is
the Masters of Arts who should rule the Universities,
and now the J urists claim to govern them, which is a
thing most indecent. But I bid you be of good cheer,
and call not in question the victory of the Cause of the
Faith. May the Lord provide for you. And now, fare
ye well-—so long as Pfqfferlrorn abideth a Christian.

The first is called the Burgher-bout‚ which beginneth
at noon and is kept a-going till four or five of the clock:
the second is the Night- or After-bout3 this beginneth
at five, and lasteth until eight, nine, or even ten of the
clock—may, it is sometimes kept up till midnight or one
of the clock in the morning. Well-to-do folk, and the
burgomasters and the guildmasters‚ when they have sat
drinking long enough at the first bout, pay their scores
