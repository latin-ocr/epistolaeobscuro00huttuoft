LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

But enough of this ; let us turn to other matters,

You bid me send you some news—so you must know
that there were high jinks here in Lent. There were
joustings, and the Prince himself rode in the Platz, and
he had a fine horse, and a fine saddle-oloth too, upon

sitting a youth, with curly looks, who played an organ
to her, as saith the Psalmist .· ‘⁴ Y oung men and maidens,
old men and children, praise the name of the Lord.”

brewed lashings of beer, and set forth toothsome fare,
and royally feasted the Prince and all his train. And

save that I wish you all good wishes. So fare ye well,
in the name of the Lord.

Scotists, and was the foe of all the seoular poets; he

celebrate a mass. M oreover, when he held the Rector-
ship at Vienna he ruled the undergraduates with a rod of
iron, and therein was most laudable. A certain fellow
once came from Moram when Ι was at Vienna, who
was by way of being a poet, for he wrote verses, and he
must needs teaeh the art of metrification—-but he was
not matriculate. Thereupon Magister Heclvman in-
hibited him ; but the rasoal was so impudent that he paid
