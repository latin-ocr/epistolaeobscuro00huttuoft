LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

you how matters stand with regard to the war and so
forth, and concerning the Isiozg of France and the
Emperor, perchance you will say within yourself,
“ See, how haughty this fellow hath become 1 He hath
a fine post in Rome, and therefore he taketh not the
trouble to write to me, forgetting that I was erst-
while his Teacher, and implanted in him Poetry, and
the Arts, and a slice of Greek too, whence it cometh
that he is no small Grecian.’' But Ι swear that it is
not so, and may the Devil take me if I have you not
ever in my thoughts and in my prayers to God. Saith
not Gregorgs that ingratitude is the root of all evil?
Wherefore he who committeth the sin of Ingratitude
sinneth the sin of sins, and if through pride Ι fail

to write to you, then am I ungrateful to you my
benefactor.

Howbeit Ι can show reasonable cause wherefore I
have not sent letters to your worship, for Ι have been
for a long while queasy‚ and I knew not what ailed
me. The leech averred that Ι had certain ill-concocted
baggage in my stomach. But the day before yesterday
Ι took a cathartic, and, saving your honour's reverenoe,
the peccant draff was as it were spoon-meat‚ and there-
with passed a white gobbet of the size of a pear: “ Lo ! ’³
quoth the leech, “the crudity that caused the fever.”
And now Ι can eat heartily again, and have a good
appetite, God be praised. If I abide in good health Ι
will write to you oft. For the nonce it must suffice to
say that His Holiness is at Florence, and the Curialists
here are cursing him because he doth not come back,
and their business is hindered. They should have
patience, say I, and should by no means curse His
Holiness, lest they should be excommunicated.

Ι quote the Law to them anent this matter—for Ι
frequent the Sapienza‚ and study there, so that Ι am
become an expert in both branches of the Law, in the
one as much as in the other. It is said that His
Holinesns‘· aileth in his eyes, and cannot walk in the
open air. You must know too that the Ising of
France hath returned to his country, and is about to
lead a greater host in array against the Emperor. The
Spaniards will help the Emperor, and so you may be
