Allagister Orth'oz sendetlt greetz'wg and humbly
commendetlt himself

EVEREND Herr Magister, you tell me that you
marvel how it cometh to pass that Ι dub myself
Juppiter. You must know, then, that when I resided
at Vienna Ι attended lectures on poetry, and there was
a certain young poet there—Geonge Sibutus by name—
who had been a pupil of Comud Celtis. He was my
eompanion, and we were ever together, and he said,
“ You ought to be named «Iuppiter, for «Iuppiter hath
in Latin the same meaning as Helferz'clz in German.”
So Jappiter is my cognomen. Sibutus now dwells at
{Vittenbengg and he has taken to himself an old trot
severity-eight years old and more. I visited his house
a while ago when Ι was making my way out of
Prias‘sia-and there sat the orone behind the stove.
“Is that your mother?” I asked. “No‚” said he,
“that is my spouse and wedded wife.'’ “thy did
you marry such an old wo1nan?'‘quoth I. He made
answer that she was still not so over-ripe as to have
lost all sapor, and had good store of pelf ; moreover she
could brew rare stingo‚ which she sold and turned to
profit. Then said Ι, “Thou hast done well; and how
6311 you your wife ἓ ”

“My Corinna? he replied, “my Lesbia, and my
Cynthia.” But let this pass.

You tell me that it seemeth to you that the Day of
Judgment is at hand: for the world hath become so
depraved that it cannot by any means grow worse, and
men wall< in such evil ways that the times are por-
tentous. The young are fain to put themselves on a
level with their elders, scholars with their teachers,
and J urists with TheologianS. All things are out of
joint, and heretics and mook Christians are springing
