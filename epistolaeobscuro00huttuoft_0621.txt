11. ³7] GEORG BLECK

whether the princes of Germcmy paid great honour to
‹loleann Ifffcjffkrlcorn. I replied that some did, and some
did not; but that nevertheless he was the trusty and
well-beloved Counsellor of the Emperor in all that con-
cerned Hebrew books and the increase of the Christian
F aith. I told him, moreover, how that the late Bishop
of Maius, of pious memory, loved him dearly, and pro-
mised him aid in all things to the extent of his power
-and when chjjj'effcorn journeyed hither and thither
on the business of the F aith he was wont to provide
him with large sums of money for his expenses. A
Theologian present said, ‘⁶ This ιῙοΙιαηνι Pfeff'erlfflrn
doth great diligence, then, in the aforesaid business Ϊί ”

Ι told him, as you had informed me, that he had
indefatigably circumambulated the whole of Germangs,
notwithstanding that it was discommodious for him at
that time to neglect his wife and children, whom it was
befitting for him to educate and maintain. Never-
theless during his absence, the Theologians ministered
not a little to his wife, affording her consolation, in-
asmuch as they knew that her husband was occupied
in the cause of the Faith. Sometimes, moreover, the
Friars from our Monastery come to her and say, ‘⁶ We
pity you in that you are so lonely.” And she replieth
‘⁶ Come then sometimes and visit me, for Ι 3111 as it
were a widow, and afford me consolation.'‘ Howbeit
the new Bishop of sslaz'nz favoureth not J oham Pfqffer-
lcorn, and the reason is that he hath other Counsellors
who strongly support Jolzamz Reuclzlin and hate the
Theologians.

This bishop‚ indeed, would not give audience to
Rffferlsorn when he desired to present him with his
‘⁶ Defence,''-as Ι learnt from your letter. All this I
related. Then one asked, “And who is this quffer-
lcorn ,2 '⁹ I replied that he was formerly a J ew—-but is
now happily baptised into the Church--and that he is
without doubt a very upright man, and of the tribe of
chcplztali, And he said, ‘⁶ Of a truth the blessing con-
ferred upon lvczplctalz‘ is fulfilled in Jolzann Efefferkorn.
For Jacob said to his son A‘aplztali, ⁶ Naphtalym shall
be a hart sent out, and giving speeches of fairness,’
Gen. xlix.” Thereafter many Divines, and Licentiates
