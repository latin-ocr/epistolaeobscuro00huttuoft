the Lords of the Council had done grievous wrong to
Aesrieampianns. But the Doctors swore that they

Some 8011110111011-00111111011015, indeed, have spread
it abroad that „lesticampianus will avenge the injury,
and cite the University before the Roman Curia. But

Α11(1 now great peace reigneth in the University.
Mag. Delitzselz lectureth on the humanities, and so doth
a Magister from Rotlzeuburg, who hath compiled a book
’ full three times as large as all the works of 172gil ,· and
in that book he hath put many mighty fine things, both
in defence of holy Mother C hurch and in praise of the
saintS. And he most of all bath praised our University,
and sacred Theology‚ and the Faculty of Arts—and
he hath reproved the secular and heathen poets. The
Masters say that his verses are as good as V i2gil'.s·, and
have no faults at all, because he knoweth quite perfectly
the Art of Metrification, and hath been a good metrist
these twenty years. Therefore the Lords of the
Council have allowed him to lecture on that book
instead of on Terence, because it is more necessary
than Terence, and is not all about drabs and clowns, as
T’wem( is.
