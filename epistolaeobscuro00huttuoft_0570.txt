LETTERS OF OBSCURE ΜΕΝ

Thomist—for their diversity is Ποῖ great, and on cer-
tain points they closely agree. Nevertheless the Holy
Doctor is the more profound, and this by the special
inspiration of the Holy Spirit3 hence it is 'chat he is
called the Holy Doctor, although Reuelzlin nameth
him Ποῖ 'chus in his writings—wherefore is he a heretic,
and, in the devil’s name, let him so abide. I was lately
wrath against a J uris’c who defended him, and Ι wrote
an ode in verse against him. For Ι, ῖοο, am wont ῖο

commentary you have constructed, and I will send
you further news in return.

Farewell-hurriedly, happily, fervidly.

From Ouum-z, iu Moravia.
