sendetlc greetc‘rzg to IVIagc‘ster Orth'n Gratius

OU have ever been minded to learn the news from
me, and just now I can, and will, send you tidings,
though I grieve that they are ill.

You must know, then, that the Friars of the Orcler
qureaclaers here held certain indulgences which they
procured from the Roman Court at a great price, and
that therefrom they derived no small gain. And then
by night some thief broke into the Church, filched more
than three hundred florins, and made off with them.
Thereupon the F riars, men full of zeal, and warmly
affectioned in the Christian Faith, were sad at heart,
and bewailed concerning that thief. And the citizens
sent hither and thither and could not find him, for he had
escaped and taken the money with him. Great is the
wickedness of such a crime, committed against the papal
indulgences and in a holy place, and the robber is ex-
communicate wherever he may be. The folk who had
been absolved, and had paid their fees into the chest,
now believe that they are unshriven: but this fear is
groundless--they are just as truly shriven as if the Pre-
dicants still possessed the money.

You must know, too, that certain fellows who sup-
port Doctor Reuclzlz'n have come hither‚ and spread
abroad many rumours, and aver that the Friars obtained
those indulgences from Rome that with their price they
might harry the Doctor, and in the cause of the Faith
trouble him ; and that folk should give them not a doit,
whatever their condition—high or low, rich or poor,
religious or secular. Not long ago I was present at
the proceedings at fisains that the Magisters instituted
against Reuclcle‘n ,· now there is a certain preacher there,
in the Cathedral, who graduated Doctor of Divinity at
Heidelberg, Bartholomew Zelcender by name—or, in the
Latin, Decimarius—and from the pulpit he enjoined all

men to come on the morrow to see the ‘⁶ Augempiegel ''
