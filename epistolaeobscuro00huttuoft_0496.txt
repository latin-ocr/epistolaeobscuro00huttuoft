LETTERS OF OBSCURE ΜΕΝ

They all shouted with rapture and great zeal——especially
St. Peter, who had a voice like a sackbut—as David
wstnesseth, “ This poor man cried.'’ The Blessecl Virgin
shouted not, but praised God in her heart, because she
knew that all these things should come to pass as the
Angel had foreshewn. And while the Apostles thus
shouted together with jubilation and devotion, an angel
came from heaven and said unto them, “Ye men of
Galilee9 why stand ye here shouting‚ and gazing· into
heaven? This same Jews· who is taken from you into
heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen‚”
and this was done that the Scripture might be fulfilled
which saith, “ They cried, and the Lord heard them.’'

The second conclusion was yet more profonnd, as
followeth: The Son of Man had his passion, his burial,
and his resurrection at Jerusalem, which is the centre
of the earth, that his resurrection should be manifest in
all regi011S‚ and that no heathen might make excuse for
his heresy, and say, “I knew not that the Lord was
risen from the dead? Now whatsoever is at the centre,
all men round about the centre can behold, but in order
that no unbeliever should find the least excuse for eva-
sion, in that place where the Lord ascended. in the
very core and centre of the earth, there hangeth a bell
that all the world can hear, and when it tolleth it
giveth forth dreadful voices concerning Doomsday and
the ascension of the Lord ; and its tolling even the deaf
attend. And from this conclusion he deduced many
corollaries which he had learnt in Paris. And when
he had ended, a certain Magister from Eyjfmff would
fain cavil at the discourse, but he was discomfited. lf
you will tell me of the books that deal with these
matters I will buy them.
