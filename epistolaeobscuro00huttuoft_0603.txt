11. 28] BERNHARD GE LFF

unlearned men, sin in that they show favour to Johann
Reuchlin: but among these are to be numbered in
Germany full ten Princes, and his Highness the
Emperor himself, and at Rome many Cardinals and
Bishops, and his Holiness Pope Leo in person, who
lately, when he had read Johann Reuchlin's letter,
highly praised the writer, and said he would defend
him against all the Friars3 and so said the Very
Reverend Cardinals of S. Marco, and S. Georgio‚ and
S. Chrysogono, and many more.

I replgs, that Pfefferkorn did this from the love of
truth, which is greater than Pope, and Emperor, and
all the Cardinals‚ and Bishops, and PrinceS. And for
this cause in his final protest (O. 4) he excuseth himself,
saying, ‘⁶ I have defended myself, truth alone being my
guide, and without offence of any man. For Jeremy
the prophet saith, ‘⁶ Cursed be he that keepeth back his
sword from blood: and, it is better to fall into the
hands of man, than into the hands of Almighty God.”
And therefore he deems it better to offend Pope and
Emperor rather than Truth—that is God. For God

is Truth.

commits heresy and High Treason in one and the same

the sword, nor with violence, I march not into the field
with a spear like a soldier of the king, (for that would be
sinful pride), etc.'⁷ Here then he saith that it is sinful
pride to make war and take the field: but the Pope
and the Emperor do this, and always have done so, and
so have many who are in the Calendar of SaintS. If,
therefore, to take the field is sinful pride, then the
saints, and the reigning Emperor, and even the Pope
have committed deadly sin, and consequently the
Church, which regards them as holy, is in error.
Hence Pfefferkorn is in direct conflict with the Canon
and Civil Law‚ with the Emperor and the Pope, with
the Church and the Empire.

I replgs, that these words are to be understood with
a reservation, namely that those who make war and
