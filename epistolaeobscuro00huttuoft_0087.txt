Jeshuruns who waxed fat in sloth‚ and kicked against
these wise and salutary rules of their Orders—ever
scheming to evade them. It was men such as these
who were the objects of the satirists' scorn. But while
the writers saw before them an Augean stable which
it would task the energies of a reforming Hercules
to cleanse‚ it had not entered into the head of any
one of them that it would be better to pull it down.

That Crotus‚ Hutten, or indeed any of the Erfurt
circle, had a definite notion whither the tendencies
they were fostering would ultimately lead is altogether
improbable. Eoban Hesse lived and died a genial
humanist; Mutian retired early from the fray‚ and,
deprived of his revenues during the Peasants’ W ar,
passed away orthodox‚ penniless‚ and weary of the
world; Crotus, as we have seen, recoiled in something
like dismay when he came to the parting of the
ways.

Hutten's case, it is true, was different. He threw
in his lot with Luther and the reformers heartily
enough, and did not draw back—yet it is always clear
that political and patriotic‚ rather than doctrinal‚ motives
actuated him. ln his ironical Dedication to Leo X. of
Lorenzo Valla's tractate on the Donation of Constantine
(1517) Hutten nowhere touches on matters of faith
and dogma: his attack is solely directed against the
scandalous sale of indulgenceS‚ the compositions for
frauds, the intolerable taxes, and the hundred and one
other ways in which Rome extorted from the merchants
and peasants of the Fatherland the wealth she required
for the aggrandisement of an extravagant court and an
ambitious pontiff.

xNe may, in fact, conveniently classify the reform-
ing tendencies of the age under four heads, overlapping
doubffless, but yet distinct in the main. First‚ a purely
intellectual revolt against the bondage of scholasticism‚
due chiefly to the revival of classical learning: secondiy,
a moral reaction—by no means the earliest—against
monkish profligacy and hypocrisy: thirdly‚ a political
and economic rebellion against the temporal authority
of Rome, and her consequent exactions; lastly‚ the
“Reformation'’ proper, which practically aimed at
