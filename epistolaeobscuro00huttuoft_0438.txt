LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

such a custom as to allow Jews to walk abroad in the
garb of Doctors of Divinity. It seemeth to me that it
is not right, but a great scandal‚ that no distinction

Theologians· Now it fell out at a junketing at his house,
when we sat drinking Torgau beer till the third hour,
that Ι was half-seas-over because that same beer had
risen into my head.

Now there was a fellow there who was at loggerheads
with me, but I pledged him in a modest cup, and he took
the greeting, but, after, lie would not do me right. Thrice
