came to the rescue.

Afterwards we came to Schongau, where we bought
some fine glasses. T hen we set forth for I η mbruclr. But
the ways were so foul that the horses could not make
way, and sank up to their girths in the mud. And so
after much tribulation we attained to [mas-brach, and
there we found his Dlajestjes the Emperor, with his vassals,
