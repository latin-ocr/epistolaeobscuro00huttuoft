LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

pleasantry such as that Ι 113176 111 31016 for you, Ι 113176
110 fear that you will take it amiss if I relate a merry
jest—for you send the like to me.

You will saffghTi-trowt for it is a mighty fine affair.
There was here of late one of the Preaohing Friars—-he
was not ill-versed in Theology, a cunning syllogiser, and
he had many patronS.

This Predieant, Herr Georg by name, was formerly
at Halle, and then he 631116 hither and held forth for
full half a year, upbraiding in his preaehments men of
all 30113 and conditions, even the Prinee himself and
his 6011111613. Η6 was, nevertheless, at the board a
hail-fellow and of good eheer, who tossed off his drams
and bumpers with the rest 3 but whenever of an evening
he drank deep with 113, 116 failed not the next morning
to preaeh about us, saying, “ Thus do the Magisters in
this University sit swilling the live-long night, fleer-
ing and fooling with their boon-companions, whose
ways they ought to mend, whereas they do but 6111166
1116111 10 evil : '' and before now he 113111 put me to very
shame.

At the last Ι waxed wroth with him, and 6331 300111
111 my mind how Ι 11113111 06 even with him-but I could
not devise 3 11163113.

One day it was told me how 11131 Predieant was
wont 10 30 by night 10 3 66113111 woman, and abuse
her, and, after, sleep with her. Hearing this, Ι 311313111-
way collected a band of eollegers, and 31 300111 1611 of
1116 61061( we went to the house, and brake into it3
whereupon the monk, desiring to escape, found no
time to bear away his garments, but leapt stark from
the window3 and Ι laughed till Ι had well—nigh piokled
myself, and cried out, “ Herr Predieant, take thy ponti-
ficals with thee 1”

Then my comrades without rolled him in the mire
and in the water, till I stayed them and told them to
use moderation. Nevertheless I lent them my aid 3 and μ
1176 311 had knowledge of the weneh.

And thus was Ι 617611 1171111 11131 monk, and never
again 113111 116 preaehed about me!

But you must not blab this forth to others, for the
Precccleing Friars are now your allies against Doetor
