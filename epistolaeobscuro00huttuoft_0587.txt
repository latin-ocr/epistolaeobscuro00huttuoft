wonderful what bad laces they make in Italy.

Herewith Ι send you a vernicle that hath touched
the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul and many other
relies—also I send an Agnus Dei. Greet for me the
reverend Doctor Heri· V alentin von Gelte7·.§·lzeim. By
the Lord‚ 1 could never have learnt logic so well had I
not resided in his hostel, for he is mightily explicit, and
