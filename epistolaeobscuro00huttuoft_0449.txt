1. 9,] OONRAD OF ZWICKAU

{ind here they follow, that you may know what
mean :—

“ Pravities heretical—fain are you to learn ¹em?
Phrases Latinistical—vultis you to turn 'em?
Then by you buyeuda the Parisians' Acta,

And the scripta newly in Lutetia facta!

Telling how Herr Reuclzlz'n from the Faith erravit,
As Magister noster Arnold well probavit:

And Magister Ortwin soon will lecture, gratis,

On them, to the members Universitatis.

Et cum on the textum he hath done enlarging,
Tum the pretty postils jotting in the margin.

Pro he first will argufy-—contra then, profoundly,
Sicut the theologers who iu Paris roundly

Swore Doctorem Reuchlin and his dissertation,
Oculare Speculum, worthy of damnation ἔ

This the brethren understand—fratres Carmelz'tae—
Sciunt too the others—clept the Jacobz'tae.”

Ι marvel how you can conceive such things. You

are wondrously skilful in your craft, and there is in
your compositions such a dulcitude that I snicker for

very joy when Ι read aught that you have written. Ι
ever hope that your life may be long and that your
fame may continue to wax as it hath to this day, inas- ι
much as your writings are of much profit.

May God keep you and quicken you, and not
deliver you into the hands of your enemies‚ as saith the
Psalmist: ‘⁶ Grant thee thy heart’s desire, and fulfil all

th mind.’'

yVVrite also to me concerning your doings, for joy-
fully do Ι hear and regard all your deeds and actions.
And so, farewell.

messum.
