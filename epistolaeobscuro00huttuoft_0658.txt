compatriots‚ have desired me to write his epitaph.
This Ι have done in manner following 1-—

“ Old Finek is dead —- His eloak was red
For him be said -- A prayer, for he
Full joyously — Right Corsic swilled,
His belly filled — and piously

Lived in true saith and charity.'’

There is one thing concerning which Ι would fain
seek instruction from you, and that is in what manner
Ι am to understand the Parisians in setting forth their
opinion conoerning the Augempiegel to use these
words, ‘⁶ W ithout reproaeh, however, to the writer

that is “Sons of Johann Reuchlin‚'' have done much
hurt to Joleann Iffsi’ffi’rlvorn, who defendeth himself,
and hath written but the truth: he desireth indeed,
that he may die if he hath lied in the smallest par-
ticular. Nevertheless, as the Psalmist saith, “All
men are liarS.’' Nor should it be objected that Johamz
Iffq‘fferlcorn was habituated to rillainy and crime from
