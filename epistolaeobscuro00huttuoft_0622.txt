and other Theologians read that book from beginning
to end, page by page, word by word, paragraph by
paragraph. But there is here a certain Oberlander
who studieth Greek, and he everywhere bruiteth it
about that it is not true either that Issssffi’rkorn is an
Imperial Coumellor, or that he ever was—and he de-
clareth that the Emperor hath written on Reuchlin’s
behalf to his Holiness, and desireth‚ without more ado,
that the Theologians will henceforth let his upright
and trusty counsellor alone. ‹Ialsob Fabri von Extaplcw,
too, of whom you have heard much, openly favoureth
Jolmnn Remelelin, although the Theologians have told
him that he ought to refrain. It is even said that in a
letter he sent to Germzmyj he declared that the 'Pheo-
logians of Paris have treated Reuehlin- just as the Jews
treated Christ. But let him say what he will, the fact
remaineth that the more part in Paris are on our side,
for the honour of the University and in despite of the
Jurists. Be therefore, of good heart, and rejoice and
be glad. Fare ye well for ever and ever.

[[ DEME ΤΗΙ( 'S ΡΗ Α LERI US to sslagelaeter

OU write to me asking how our University com-
porteth itself with regard to the Cause of the
Faith-—whether it taketh your part, or that of ‚Iolmrm
Reuelzlin. You must know, therefore, that throughout
the whole of *S'witzerlaml the Brethren of the ()rder of
Preachers are in ill odour and deep disgrace by reason
of those innocent Friars who were burned at Berue—
for Ι shall never believe that they did the deeds imputed
to them. 'l'herefore are their Monasteries deserted‚
while the Monasteries of the Franciscans flourish: and
where one man giveth alms to a Dominican‚ twenty
give to Minorites, Augustinians and the rest. It is
said that it hath been prophesied that the Order of
l'reachers will be wholly blotted out.
