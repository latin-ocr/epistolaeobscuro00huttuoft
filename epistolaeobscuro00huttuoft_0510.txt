LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

of evils’' meaneth the Day of Doom in the V alleg] of*
Jelzoslmpleat, when account of all sins must be rendered.
Other arguments Ι omit for brevity's sake, for we at
onfurt are moderns, and the moderns ever delight in
brevity, as you know. Moreover, in that my memory is
weak, Ι cannot learn by rote a multitude of citations, as
do the JuristS.

But there are others who oontend that this argument
holdeth not, and they quote I’lcezatus on their side, who
saith: ‘⁶ What is done cannot be undone.'' From this
they prove that if a J ew in the days of his J udaism hath
lost any portion of his eorporality he will by no means
reoover it in Christian baptism. They argue, too, that
their opponents’ proof eonoludeth illogically3 for, from
their major premiss it would follow that Christians
who had, through loose living, suffered some carnal de-
fieiency—as happeneth many a time to both secular and
spiritual persons—would also be held to be Jews at the
Last J udgment.

But this is an heretical conclusion‚and our M asters the
Inquisitors of Hei-etieal Pravity will by no means grant
it, seeing that they themselves are now and then a trifie
s? lacking thereabouts—a mishap which occurreth to them
:1 by no means from consorting with wrmtons, but from
ἴς laek of care at the baths. Most humbly and devotedly

I pray your worship, therefore, to determine the truth
of this matter once for all by your deeision, and to make
enquiries of Herr Ps'efferlcorn’s wife, seeing that you
stand in her good graeeS, and she will not be backward
in telling you whatsoever you ask in the name of the
close friendship you have with her husband. Moreover,
Ι hear that you are her confessor, and therefore you may
compel her to due obedience under pain of penance.
Say to her: ‘⁶ Madam, be not bashful! Ι know you
foras honest a lady as any in Cologne: and nothing dis-
honest do Ι ask from you. I do but seek to learn the
truth from you: is your husband of the circumcision,
or not ἓ Speak boldly, without shame 1 Od’s life 1 have
,you lost your tongue?” But I must not presume to
instruet you, for you know much better than Ι how to
f deal with women. Ι write in haste.

From Enrun‘r : at the sign of the Dragon.
