wrong if we say that his sojourn in Italy had made
him, in the literal sense of the word, a free-thinker—
but a free-thinker who felt no impulse to impose his
own saith, or want of faith, upon the world at large.
U'e need not be greatly surprised‚ therefore, to learn
that on returning to the Fatherland in 1503, Mutian
accepted, without hesitation, a canonry at Gotha.
Here, inscribing “Beata 'l'ranquillitas’' above his
study door, he resolved to spend the rest of his days
in learned leisure. Other preferments were proffered

Society there was doubtless as dull as it was limited,
and a scholar who does not write must converse.
F ortunately his old university was scarce twenty miles
away, and Mutian began to betake himself thither,
often for considerable periods,

the young disciples who from time to time sat round
Mutian's easy-chair, and hung with mingled joy and
