LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

who care not much what the corn costs, sit long at the
After-bout, and drink for dear life.

Now it happened that we were of late thus making
merry, and there was with us Herr Peter, a friar of
the Order of Poeachers, who is mightily well disposed
towards you by reason of Jalsol) van Hoogstraten the
Inquisitor at Cologne,· and between ten and eleven at
