INTRODUCTION

This is not the voice of the true Reuchlin. We
hear, rather, the accents of the student, getting on
in years, and dreading lest he should be torn from
his beloved studies, and hurled into a vortex of ecclesi-
astical strife. But the die was cast. Never again
would he with placid mind ponder a scholar's dreams
while he fed his pet peacocks at Stuttgart. He had
been caught in a stream from which there was no
escape. He may be forgiven if he cursed the day that
saw Pfefferkorn⁷s baptism l

The Jews bought the Augenspiegel eagerly. The
Dominicans--who no longer sought to shelter behind
their stalking-horse, Pfefferkorn——tried to suppress it,
but heedlessly playing into their adversaries' hands,
inveighed against it from their pulpits. In short, they
fitted on the cap without hesitation, and declared
that it was none other than their august Order which
this mere jurist had dared to accuse of unchristian
conduct!

On September 7, 1511, Pfefferkorn was permstted,
apparently out of sheer bravado, to preach a sermon
outside the church at Frankfort‚ and to conclude his
discourse with a solemn benediction.1 This was a
dangerous experunent,for·unauthofised preachers had
before then been condemned to the stake‚ and Pfeffer-
korn later on, in alluding to the matter, thought it
prudent to assume a somewhat apologetic tone, and
declared that he had not preached “pontificaliter'’
concerning mysteries of the Church, but had merely
addressed his Christian audience on—usury ἱ ² No one,
surely, could object to a lecture on compound interest
-asssssfiect,he nfight have added,that·fflnzsensaffional
arithmetical tables published in his Praise ami Glory
of sslaoez'miliau proved the lecturer to have made
peculiarly his own.

The next few months were chiefly occupied in
comespondence between lxeuchhn and the (kssogne
theologianS. The result was merely an exacerbation
of the controversy. On March 22, 1512, Reuchlin
issued another German pamphlet in his own defence.3
