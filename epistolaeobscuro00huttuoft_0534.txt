LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Now when he had finished speaking, my wrath was
greatly inflamed, and Ι cried‚ ‘⁶ You ought not to utter
such words as these. Put case that they be true——
nevertheless they should not be uttered, for it might
well happen that destruction might come upon them
in a single hour--as it did upon the Templars—if men
should learn of their iniquities 1 '⁷

T hen quoth he, ‘⁶ I know further of matters that I
could not write of on twenty sheets of paper.''

Then said I, ‘⁶ Why would you write against all the
Predicants? All of them have not done such deeds:
if those in fflaz'nz, and Augsbmg, and Strczsburg are
wicked‚ nevertheless others are upright.” Said he,
‘⁶ Why darest thou to contradict me? Ι verily believe
that thou art the son of a Predicant‚ or hast been a
Predicant thyself ! Show me a Monastery wherein
there are upright Dominicans 1” 'l'hen said Ι, “ What
have those at Frcmlffort done ἲ ” Said he, ‘⁶ Knowest
thou not? It is their Principal who is named l‘Vigand,
and he is the head and front of all their iniquities. He
it was who started that heresy at Reme, and who wrote
a book against von Wesel, which he afterwards at Heidel-
berg recanted, annulled, and blotted out3 and he it
was who afterwards wrote another book intituled ‘ The
Tocsin‚' and he was not courageous enough to issue it
under his own name, but suborned J ohan η Rfiffkrlcorn to
set it forth under his name, for halfof the profit—which
would well content him, for he knew that Iffqfferkoru
was a reckless man, and, like all Jews, regarded not his
own good fame so long as he could make money.”

Now when I perceived that the more part were
against me, I went my way, but I was sorely vexed
that the fellow was not alone, for if he and I had been
by ourselves, Ι would have played the devil with him.
F arewell.

From S‘rnixsssURG: on Wednesday, after the Feast of St. Berrzctrd,
in the year one thousand five hundred and sixteen.
