11. 26] HEINRICH SCHAFMAUL

at Cologne ten years agone, told me that he believed
not that Pszqfferlmrn was yet a good Christian: for he
declared that he met him a year back and that he still
stank like any other J ew-and yet it is common proof
that when Jews are baptised they 5111611 rank no longer.
He believeS‚ therefore, that Iffj'cjfferlvorn is still a knave
at the back of his head, and when the Theologians
think him the best of Christians he will turn Jew
again: “We should put no trust in him‚’' quoth he,
“for all men have misgivings concerning baptised
Jews.’'

Then said Ι, “Sonty! Will you syllogise on a
suspicion? ⁶ Men suspect baptised Jews to be
botched Christians—therefore Pjigfferlcorn is a botched
Christianl’ It followeth not. Ι might be apt to
suspect Doctor Δ»1771οΙῑῖ von Tongern to be of the brood
of Soclom—-yet would it not therefore be sooth, for all
the Colognese hold him to be an unspotted virgin.
Moreover, I will resolve that other objection of yours:
you say that Pfeffierlvrn savoureth: put case that he
doth-though Ι believe it not, neither have 1 ev er
perceived it—then Ι maintain that there is another
cause of this emanation; foi Jolzann Pfff'mlcw 77 when
he was a Jew was a fieshe1 by trade, and flesheis are
commonly rank.''

'l'hen all they who stood near vowed that my
reasoning was just. So I conjure you that you dis-
quiet not yourself overmuch 1n this matter, for a broken
spilit dlieth the bones. F arewell

Ortuinus Gratius 77111773] greetings

INASMUCH as before I journeyed to Court you
charged me to write to you oft, and propose from
time to time knotty points in Theology, which you
would straightway resolve better than the Courticians

at Rome.- therefore, I now write to ask your reverence
