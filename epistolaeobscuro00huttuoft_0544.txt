LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

solemnly spake he his reasons: “ Most eximious Herr
Prothonotary, since, as Α ristotle saith, it is profitable to
make enquiry conoerning each and all; therefore hath
your Eximiousness proposed to me a question, to wit,
{for what cause did Magister Ortwin, in publishing a
{new Collection of Letters, entitled them ίΕρὶςιῗοίαε
ἕΟΖ)3ς·α7·07ηιηι V irorata.³ By favour of these gentlemen‚
Ι pronounee my opinion that Magister Ortwin, who is

,ra learned man and a philosopher, cognominated his

ffriends ‘Obscure Men' in a mystical sense: for I

ἶ once read in an authority that truth lieth in obscurity.

ᾗ XVherefore also saith «Ιοὸ, ‘ He discovereth deep things

ness hideth not from thee, the night shineth as the day:
the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.'”
And after the aforesaid Theologian had made an end
of speaking, all regarded me, to mark whether I was
persuaded. But Ι pondered over these words.

There was present Bernhmd Gc'lffss a Magister of
Paris, a youth indeed, but, as I hear, of good parts,
and one who studieth much, and maketh fair progress

in the Arts, and moreover hath good grounding in ⁹

Theology. And he, after his manner, shaking his head
this way and that, spake thus with a grave counte-
nance: “Learn, Gentlemen, the weighty and reason-
able cause wherefore Magister Ortwin calleth his friends
‘ Obsoure Men? He doeth it sor humility’s sake. For,
you may know, and even if you know not it may be
presumed that you do know, how that three years ago
ιῙοΙιαηφι Reueldin, when he published a Collection of
Letters from his friends, entitled it ⁶ Epistolae Clarorum
