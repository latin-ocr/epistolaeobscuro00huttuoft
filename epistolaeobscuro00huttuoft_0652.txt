CI J OHANN HELFERICH (latine J uppiter) to
stlagz'ster Orth‘n sendetlc greetiwg and humbly
commendem himself

REVEREND Herr Magister, you tell me that you
marvel how it cometh to pass that I dub myself
Juppiter. You must know, then, that when Ι resided
at Vienna Ι attended lectures on poetry‚ and there was
a certain young poet there—George Sibutus by name-—
who had been a pupil of Conrad Celtis. He was my
eompanion, and we were ever together, and he said,
‘⁶ You ought to be named Juppiter, for Juppz'ter hath
in Latin the same meaning as Hefferz'clz in German.”
So Juppz'ter is my cognomen. Sibutus now dwells at
mmmmm-g, and he has taken to himself an old trot
seventy-eight years old and more. I visited his house
a while ago when I was making my way out of
Pr‘zcssia-—and there sat the orone behind the stove.
“Is that your 1nother?'’ I asked. “No‚” said he,
“that is my spouse and wedded wife.” “Why did
you marry such an old woman?’' quoth I. He made
answer that she was still not so over-ripe as to have
lost all sapor, and had good store of pelf ; moreover she
could brew rare stingo‚ which she sold and turned to
profit. Then said Ι, “ Thou hast done well; and how
eall you your wife ἓ ”

“My C07·imza‚” he replied, “my Lesbia, and my
Cynthia? But let this pass.

You tell me that it seemeth to you that the Day of
Judgment is at hand: for the world hath become so
depraved that it cannot by any means grow worse, and
men walk in such evil ways that the times are por-
tentous. The young are fain to put themselves on a
level with their elders‚ scholars with their teachers,
and J urists with TheologianS. All things are out of
joint, and heretics and mook Christians are springing
