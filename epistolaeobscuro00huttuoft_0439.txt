1. 4] JOHANN KANNEGIESZER

this fellow smoketh you, he giveth himself aim, and is
always seeking to put you down ! ” And Ι was so moved l

with wrath that 1 took up the tankard and smote him

on the ate.

The-{31 the Poet flew into a rage, and said that I made
a tumult in his house; and he bade me begone in the
Devil’s name.

T hen quoth I, ‘⁶ What care Ι tho' you are my enemy ἲ
Ι have had enemies to the full as curst as you, and yet I've
worsted them. And what tho' you are a Poet? I have
Poets who are friends of mine. and they are just as good
as you. To the jakes with your poetry! What do you
take me for 2 Thinkest thou I'm a gowk, or that I grew
on a tree, like an apple 2 ”

Thereupon he called me an ass, and said that I had
never seen a Poet.

Then eried I, “There's an ass in your own hide!
I've seen a sight more Poets than you !”

Then I held forth about yOU, and about Doctor von
Zutplzen of Isuz‘jlc Hostel, who compiled the Commen-
tary, and about Domine Roger the Licentiate in Divinity
at De IVIonte Hostel—and with that Ι flung out of the
house, and we are at feud to this day.

Now, therefore, I beg most earnestly that you will
send me but an exemplar of your art, and Ι will flourish
it before that Poet and the rest, and Ι will make boast
that you are my friend, and a sight better Poet than he.

Be sure you tell me what Domine J οΙιαηη Pfefferlcorn
is doing3 whether he still maintaineth his quarrel with
Doctor Rem-felin, and whether you still take up the
eudgels on his behalf, and send me Some news. Fare-
well in Christ.
