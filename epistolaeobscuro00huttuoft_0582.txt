‚ In a word, greetings infinite Ι offer you, reverend
1113813161, 101 you are beloved by me to the verge 01
<1 possibility—with love unfeigned. But you may say
’11131 Ι pretend this affection, and that you do not
'believe it to be so heartfelt‚ therefore Ι 111111 say but
little about it. The saying goes, “Self-praise defileth
the lips‚” or vulgarly, “Eigenlob stinkt.’' Never-
theless in token of my love I send you herewith
two gifts3 the first is a rosary made out 01 ox-horn‚
which hath touched the tomb of Saint Peter and Saint
Paul, and many other relies at Rome. And over this
Ι 113116 1·63(1 111166 11133363. They say that it is sovran
against robbers and all murderous 333311113, 11 0116 16116111

for. There was a man here in the chnpo dei Fz'ori
who worked miracles by virtue 01 St. Paul, and he
had a mort 01 serpents of terrible shapeS‚ so that it
was a marvel to behold. He touched them and they
did him no hurt——but when they bit any one else,
then he cured him by this talisman‚ giving him this
kickshaw tied up3 and they say that he is 01 11131
stock on which St. Paul conferred healing power. For
when St. Paul walked the earth he was once enter-
tained by a man who treated him with the greatest
reverence, and played the good fellow, giving him
victuals and drink and good lodging, and in the morn-
ing he asked him, saying‚ ‘⁶ Sir, take it not amiss—I

from God‚ and Ι doubt not that you are a saint, for
but yesterday I saw you work a miracle. Tell me,
