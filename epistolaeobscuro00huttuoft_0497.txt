ΕΙ WILLIBRORD NJ GE TI, oftlze Order of Willeel-
mites, Cursor in Tlceology, by authority qs'tlee most
reverend tlte General of leis Order, commendem
himself to Bartlcolomew Uolso, qualg'fied Baclzelor in
Theology, of the Orcler of Carmelz‘tes

As many as drops in tlw miclst of the sea,
Or Beguz'71.s· in lzoly Cologne that there be—
As many as lmirs on ajaclcass’s hide ,-

So many my greeting.s·—cmd many beside.

VENERABLE Herr Carmelite Colp‚ your Order, I
trow, is of the highest, and many the indulgences
that you hold from the Apostolic See: no other Order
may take precedence of your Order, and many are the
cases you can absolve in confession when penitents are
contrite and humble and would fain communicate.

Ι therefore desire to propound to your worship a
theological question. This you are well qualified to
determine, since you are an Artsman of parts, and can
ably preach‚ and are full of zeal and of a good con-
science3 moreover I have heard that you have a fine
library in your Convent, in which are many books con—
cerning Holy Scripture, and Philosophy, and Logic, and
Petrus Hispanus,- the magistral syllabus, too, of the
Lawrenee Hostel, Cologne, where resideth acting regent
Doctor von Tongern—at man right zealous, profoundly
versed in speculative Theology, and enlightened in the
Catholic Faith. Him a certain Doctor of Laws sought
to vex, but—this fellow having no craft in formal dis-
putation nor in the Book of Sentences—the Magisters
heeded him not.

Now, above all, Ι hear that in the library aforesaid,
where the Cursors in Theology study, there is confined
by a chain of iron a most notable book, named The
Combibilatz'ons, which containeth authoritative opinions
in Theology, and the first principles of Holy Scripture.
This Book, I hear, a certain Divine of Paris bequeathed
to you upon his death-bed-when he made confession
