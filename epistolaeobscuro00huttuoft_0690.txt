LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

their habit, and are not all shaven and shorn as we are3
and when any relaxation is taken away from them—for
instance, if their wine be docked for some transgression
—then have they other solace, for they can procure
doxies by the aid of lame Johcmn the wood-cutter who
crawleth on his hands and knees. You may say, ‘⁶ Such
a dissolute life is not permitted to the Sanctispirituales.”
But I tell you that Ι have heard for sooth that their
Superior—who, though old, lame, grey, and blear-eyed‚
is nevertheless avid in that matter, but not always the
man he was-is wont to keep a laced-mutton in his
study; and when he casteth her aside he provideth her
with a husband, and giveth her a good dowry out of the
treasury of the Holy Spirit, which never runneth low,
for it abideth by the mere grace of the Spirit. Then he
getteth another wench and doeth as I have said, and
thus the order increaseth and multiplieth in secret.
And now will I cite a proverb: “Whensoever the
Abbot—that is the Father Superior—throweth the
dice, the friars can play.” That is, since our old
prelates are so licentious, and lead such loose lives, it
followeth that we underlings may imitate them. This
is a sound conclusion, for Ι have seen in a tractate “ De
Suppositionibus'’ that ‘⁶ Prelatus supponit personaliter,''
but, according to Bsarsilius, ‘⁶ Supponit inferius materi-
aliter.'’ And now to the main point: Ι would that if
Doctor Jalfob van Hoogstraten cannot win his cause
against Johcmn Benclzlin, he would obtain for us a
milder Rule, such as that aforesaid. For the flesh will
be served, and I know full well that my days will be
short in the land if Ι may not at some time or other
cast out the old leaven that I have derived from those
cheeseS. Pardon me in that Ι speak to you cordially,
that is out of my inmost heart. I am ever in dread
lest that Cause should have a bad end—as did the
Cause at Berne. You well know what Ι mean.

Herr Magister· noster J olzamz Eimerielefdesiretl1 you
many greetings. He hath become a very holy man.
He is now our preacher‚ and everybody praiseth him.
He is mighty fine at signs and symbols: in the year of
Our Lord 1516 he preached on the Passion, and he
took with him a staff into the pulpit, and when he read
