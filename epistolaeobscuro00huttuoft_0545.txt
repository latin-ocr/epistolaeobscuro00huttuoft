11. 1] JOHANN LAssIA

and perpending much thereon, said within himself:
‘ Lo, Reuclclin believeth that none save he himself hath
any friends ι what will he do if I prove that Ι 100 have
many friends—worthier far, and able to write better
metrifications and oompositions than his friends Γ
And so, to put him to shame he sent to the press those
LetterS‚ and entitled them ⁶ Epis-tolcae Obscurorwn Vir-
orum..³ As saith the Psalmis-t, ‘ He sent darkness and made
it dark.’ But this he did in lowliness, belittling and
humbling himself, that he might say with the Rsalmist,
‘ Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty.’
XVherefore the Lord, beholding his humssity, will in
due time give him grace to send abroad mighty works
and name them with exalted titles. As saith «1οὸ .·
‘ And again after darkness Ι hope for the day.’ But
it must not be supposed that that letter-book of the
friends of Magister Ortwin is not artistieally eomposed
—for Jolamn Remu-lelius friends never in their lives
could compose anything better3 n0, not to save their
neoks—but, as I have deelared, more excellent eoneeits
will ensue; and, by God’s help, I hope we may see
great things.

‘⁶ Magister Ortwin layeth no store by swelling 111163.
Wherefore he saith, ‘The Lord is my light and my
salvation, whom then shall I fear3’ For he knoweth
that in belittling himself he will hereafter be magnified.
As saith the Scripture, ‘⁶ thoso exalteth himself will
be brought low.’ And, as we read in the twentieth
of Ecclesiccstiezas·, ‘There is an abasement because os
glory, and there is that lifteth up his head from a low
estate.' These things the Prophet lValcum prophesied
when he said, ‘And darkness shall pursue his ene1nies.’ '⁷

Then, desiring that the disputants should not be
out with one another, and that neither of them should
fall foul of me for saying, “this or that is the subtler
reasoning,” Ι quoted that line of Horace in which he
saith, “The ease is still before the judge.’' “When
next Ι write to Magister Ortwin,” I added, “I will ask
him to tell me his motive. Forgive me, therefore, if Ι
have in any wise perplexed you.”

So then they disputed no longer, though Magister
Bernlcccrd muttered that he would contend to the stake
