11. 61] PETER LIEB

he cannot, in honour, mention his father, because his
father is a priest, and if he were named after his father
all folk would know that he was the son of a priest and
a whore-——and a bastard if ever there were one 1 '' Then
again I cried aloud‚ saying, 66 How can this thing be?
Is he not a Magister of Cologne? Hath not the Uni-
versity a statute which declareth that no man may
graduate unless he be legitimate? Therefore—'' Then
saith he, 66 Whether graduates must be legitimate or
illegitimate, the fact remaineth that Magister Ortzcz'n
is a bastard, and a bastard he will 101113111 world without
end ! '' Then said Ι, 66 But what if the Pope hath per-
01131100 given him dispensation ’ἐ Then he would be
legitimate after all, and you would be in grievous error,
speaking against the Chureh of Rome ,ι’ ” Then said
he, “ It matters not if he had a thousand dispensations
—he would not be legitimate for all that.''

Then he cited a case in point, 66 Take the case of a
Jew baptised with the water of baptism: if the Holy
spirit be absent, the water profiteth nothing, and he is
still a J ew. So it is with those bastards who are the sons
of priests and whores—for priests cannot lawfully enter
into wedloek with whores, and therefore a dispensation
profiteth their children nothing '’ Then Ι asked him,
saying‚‘ ‘What opinion holdest thou concerning Herr
J olzamz Pfeffe? ko? n. ?” And he answe1 mg said,‘ ‘I firmly
believe that he 1s still a J ew ’And ln reply to the eita-
tions made he furthe1 quoted Matthew 1ii., where it is
written‚“ Unless a man be born again of water and of
the spirit he shall not enter into eternal life.’' “And
since,” saith he, 66 Pfigfferlcom was not born again of the
Spirit, the water profiteth him nothing, and he will abide
a J ew for ever.” Then I could no longer answer him,
and we arose, Heri· Peter and I, and went home to bed.
And now Ι 11031 that this reprobate boasteth himself
that he hath overeome us in disputation, and is more
learned than Herr Pete? or myself. W herefore Ι play
your worthiness to write and tell me how those argu-
ments about dispensations and Herr Jolzamz Pftgffey-
1107 η 's baptism may best be met, and how this raseal may
be hoist with his own petard.

May Ι (10301νο your favour all my life long. Farewell.
