making light 01 11131 book. Have you no sense of
shame ’ἕ ” And in high dudgeon I departed from him.

So, be well assured, Ι shall hie me back to Ger-
mngs ; for there Magisters are paramount3 and rightly.
I 0311 prove it by the Gospel: Christ called himself
Magister, and not Doctor, saying, “ Ye 0311 1116 Μ33161
and Lord, and ye say well, 101 30 Ι 3111.”
