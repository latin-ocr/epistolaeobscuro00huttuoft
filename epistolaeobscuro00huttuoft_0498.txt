LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

and revealed certain secrets out of Bonaventura—and he
ordained that no man should read therein save members
of your Order, but to them so doing the Pope granteth
certain indulgences and remissions.

Near this book lie Henrz'cus de H assia, and V eruens,
and all the other Commentators on the Book of Sen-
tences, in the which you are versed, and are therefore
a tower of strength in every disputation, whether of
ancients or modernS‚ Scotists or Albertists, or even of
those who are of the sect of Kuick Hostel in Cohgm,
and have a syllabus all their own.

Therefore I beseech you, heartily and m all charity,
that you will take not amiss my petition, but will give
me good counsel m my perplexity ln so far as in you lies,
and will ’quote to this end what the Doctors lay down
thereon m replication and conclusion. Now the afore-

same with a priest at Fulda, deeply read in the afore-
said writings‚ who hath found naught thereon in the
Cataflogue or in the books themselves: he is kinsman of
the Pastor there, who is a poet——for he is a good latiniser
and he can indite theses withal. Moreover, I am my-
self vicar at the monastery here and have the cure of
many communicants-—persons from whom I can make
quest. Our Superior himself hath openly declared that
he cannot resolve this question, with ease to his con-
science, notwithstanding that he hath attended the
disputations of many Doctors at Paris and Cologrze*
for he is a qualified licentiate, and hath responded in
due form and manner to that end.

If you ale unable to decide this matter, I beg you
to make enquiiy of Magister Oltzein, and he will a:make
all things clear—>Gratius is he called by virtue of that
divine grace within him which knoweth all things. I
have put together an heroic ode concerning the book
aforesaid3 prithee read it and correct it, and make a
mark where I have a foot too much or too little ε learn,
