enlteintz, since he taketh great pleasure 111 11611- -ringing
He is a 111051 skilful 111 111, and bath a maivellous in·
tellect; you would scarcely credit the profundity of
his genius. He is ever ready for a disputaffion, and
when 116 argueth, he laugheth; and by his laughter
he putteth down his adversary. When he saw ιΙοΙιαηη
ΕεῑισΙιῖἰηῗε heretical theses he declared that on the
score of a single one of them Reuclelin ought to 116
burned.

Next you can reckon amongst your company a
young nobleman and soldier, Blattlzias von Falkenbeog
by name: 116 15 3 very warlike man, and goeth ever
armed as becometh 3 knight3 he always sitteth on
the hither side of the board, and never behind it—
for, as he saith, it is not possible for one sitting behind
the table to leap up on a sudden and 5111116 0116’5 foes
if war should break out. He is moreover a very subtle
disputant after the school of 1116 3110161115, and he de-
clareth that if Reuehslin doth 1101 yield, he will come
10 your aid with 3 hundred horse. 'lhen there is a
burghei of Blae‘nz named JV e‘gand zon Solms. Η6 15
11111 3 youth, yet 50 learned that he 15 1116 equal of a
Magister- -1,105161 and he 531111 11131 116 would fain dis-
pute with Reuehlz‘n for 1611 fiorins. A little while
ago he out-argued ιῙοΙιαήη Huttz'clz 50 11131 116 was
undone and could answer nothing.

Besides these there is also on your side Hem·
IVerulzer, who is prodigiously well up in the
‘⁶ Summa T homae contra Gentiles '³ and knoweth
the “Formalitates” of Dans Scotus by rote—and
he saith that if Magister van Hoogstraten were not
already at the Curia he would go there himself and
settle Johann Reuclzliu. These 311165 of yours that
I have named, meet together once 3 week 31 1116
1101156 of the eminent Herr Magister-noster Bartho-
lomew, who is chiefest of all your friends, and there
they discuss matters of mighty abstruseness. They
oppose one another in turn, and one holdeth the
opinion of Jolzamz Beue-lilia while the rest argue
against him, and their disputes are very notable.

Of the others here who 316 011 your side I have
no knowledge, for they are not of my acquaintance.
