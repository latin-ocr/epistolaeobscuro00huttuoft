but we may agree with M. Millet that he was, for
France, “ le pere de la grande comedie,’⁷ ¹ and that
but for him Moliere would not have been, without
attributing to him any great share in the spread of
the Renaissance in his country. But Herder was
referring to political rather than to literary influence,
and it is therefore possible to agree with him without
placing the Epistolae upon a particularly high pedestal.

An influence, however, of more definite extent and
degree has been claimed for the satire by Hamilton. He
roundly declares his opinion that it was European in
its influence‚ and that ‘⁶ it gave the victory to Reuchlin
over the Begging Friars‚ and to Luther over the Court
of Rome.'’

Two quite different things, be it remarked. In the
case of Reuchlin versus the Dominicans the issue had
been trembling in the balance for some time ; king and
emperor were pulling in different directions, and the
prestige of the pope did not at the time appear to be
directly or indirectly at stake. A slight push would be
sufficient to give victory—if a barren one—to Reuchlin.
In our opinion the Epistola& gave the push, and the
victory--though a barren one.

But the victory of Luther, if victory it was even in
his case, was the issue of a bloodier fray. It was not
till six months after the publication of the second series
of the Epistolae that Luther cast down the gage at
Wittenberg: it was three or four years before the battle
was 'oined.

1}OE did the authors of the satire prepare the ground,
and thus make the victory easier ’.ἰ Luther himself on
more than one occasion inferentially acknowledged that
in his opinion this is what they had done. And if the
fiery monk's strife had been with the Dominicans alone,
and not with the whole might of Rome, he would have
been right, without qualification. The satire had de-
clared that the upholders of the musty methods of
scholasticism--with which, be it always remembered,
the Church in Germany had disastrously identified her-
self—were not the repositories of all learning that they
perhaps honestly thought themselves to be—but a pack
