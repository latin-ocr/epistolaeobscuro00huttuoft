OU have lately sent 1116 a 'most vituperative letter,

and you lay it to my charge that Ι tell you not
how standeth the controversy, concerning the Faith,
with Johann Rene-Idm. When I read the letter Ι was
very wrath, and said, “therefore writeth he to me
in this fashion? Have I not sent him two letters in
less than half a year 1 15 it my fault that the messengers
have not delivered them 3 ”

you should w alk on his feet through the mire and clayl’
He made answer‘, ‘Some with ehariots‚ and some with
horses3 but we come in the name of the Lord.''
Quoth I, “Yea‚ but now it raineth sorely‚ and it is
bitter cold.” Τ116Π lifted he up his hands towards
heaven, saying‚ ‘⁶ Drop down, ye heavens‚ from above,
and let the skies pour down righteousness ¹ ”

these parlous straits? ''Iwo years ago I saw him enter
