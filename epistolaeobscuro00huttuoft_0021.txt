PREFACE

sixteenth century. No student of the lampoons of the
Middle Ages expects to find them couched in terms
of impeccable decorum. From Aristophanes to Swist,
through that long line which includes the authors of
the Narrensclzff the Encomz‘um Bloriae, and Panta-
gruel, satirists have claimed, and exercised, the right
of waging war on folly, vice, ignorance, and hypocrisy‚
not only with barbed arrows but, upon occasion, with
weapons more nearly allied to the malodorous missiles
of Eastern pirates.

In exhibiting this freedom‚ here and there, the
Epistolae do but resemble their congeners; but one
thing is certain—coarseness is never introduced into
them for its own sake, or as mere buffoonery to please
the groundlings. Burke, in a well-known passage,
speaks of an epoch in which “vice itself lost half its
evil by losing all its grossness ”3 perhaps our authors
were moralists of sterner stuff, and did not believe in
the desirability of completely defecating vice; so they
preserved some of its grossness, the better to scoff at

its stupidity.
· After all, as for the Obscure Men themselves, it is
impossible for us to be very angry with them: when
we feel inclined to chastise one of the saucy simpletons,
he puts on a look of such comic deprecation, and
makes such frank confession, that we are disarmed:
we can but turn aside, to hide a smile.

In the Introduction some account has been given
of the singular sequence of events that led to the
publication of the Satire3 the vexed question of its
authorship is touched upon, and an attempt has been
made to sketch in outline portraits of some of the
personages concerned, who, though far from insignifi-
cant, are to-day scarcely known even by name, except
to historical specialists.

The Ερῑζςίοῖαε, lying as they do between two great
epochs of history, are inextricably entangled in the
web of each, and the difficulty of compressing almost
indispensable elucidations within what are perforce
narrow bounds has been acutely felt. The main
stream of the narrative may seem to lie smoothly
enough before uS, but some tempting backwater pre-
