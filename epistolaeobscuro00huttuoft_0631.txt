become a monk of your Order, for Ι have a strong
hankering thereafter.’' Hence I write to you from
my heart. But it irketh me mightily that Secular
Theologians should now-a-days be so over-weening—
as is Doctor Jolcamz Reiss, who is a preaeher at the
Cathedral in this Burg. He is held in high esteem,
and all the Canons and nobles make much of him;
for he knoweth how to gloze them with fair words,
Yet this Doctor seemeth to be mightily prejudiced
against the Regulars. One told me, who often sat
with him at board, that he altogether holdeth a way
of his own, and is neither an Albertist, nor a Scotist‚
nor an Oceamist, nor a Thomist. And if any one
asketh him, “Most excellent Herr Doctor, of what
way are you?” he answereth, “ The way of Christ.”
He laugheth when the Doctors of Theology call them-
selves Magisternosters.

Moreover he holdeth not greatly with the Regulars,
saying that it is not needful for us to put on a cowl,
but that we can be saved by other means. He declareth
that God hath no respect for vesture. In this he
seemeth to me to be heretical, for he laeketh reverence
towards the Regulars and the Holy Father. He useth
moreover an uncouth method of preaehing—for he doth
not, as do others, propound subtle questions and con-
struet arguments eontra, and afterwards solve them
and deduce Corollaries, but he proceedeth without art
or rule. I marvel, therefore, that folks listen his
sermons gladly, for he preacheth not canonically. I
have by two instanees been convineed that he is ill-
disposed towards Regulars. Once when you at Cologne
instituted, with the aid of our Order universally, that
laudable strife against Jolzann Rem-lehn, I brought
him a paper containing the decree concerning Jolzaom
Reuelzlz'n, that his book should be burned and he
himself be forced to recant. I said to him, as Ι had
been instructed by our Provincial‚ “Excellent Herr
Magisternoster, your excellence here hath a decree
that Reuclzlz'n is a heretie and that his book is to be
burned. Be pleased‚ therefore, to publish it from the
pulpit3 and at the same time we request you to join
us in withstanding the aforesaid he1·eti0.'’
