11. 9} PHILIPP SCHLAURAFF

In the streets to basely swinge me, ‘⁶ Dash to bits the
runnion's jowl!
Is he not the bane of Reuehliu, and a Theologian foul 2 ’⁹

“W hence doth come this callow bejan?'’ Crotus
eried‚ ‘⁶ He is unknown ! ’⁹
‘⁶ I'm a graduate2’' “Get thee gone then!’' Ι was

minded to Cologne,

'Phrough the Bac-leenwald to journey‚ but a comrade
eried, ‘⁶ Beware ! '’

X‘Varning vme of fllutiamcs, with his bludgeon, lurking

'shro’iinglieCo'ampanien Ι evaded‚ and again to Meissen came,

But to A esticampicmtcs all too quickly spread the fame-—

Straight he sent forth his dimiples, and they dragged
me by the hair,

And his neighbour Spalatz‘nus came and threatened
then and there

For a private grudge to swinge me—but my bruised
and battered hide

Hardly saving, Ι escaped me to a forest dark and wide ;

Did lthei Devil, or an angel of the Pit my footsteps

Theneiio Sturmcs? *When he saw me parlous was my
plight indeed Σ

Merey! How my lugs he basted! So Ι fled in evil

To ἓῗῗιῗῖῗοηὶαἶς· river valley-—and met Hutten face to

Solexiiiieoath, with upraised fingers, made he that a
seourglng sore

He would give me if Ι lingered—so to save my skin,
once more

On Ι hurried into Swubia, and to Augsbmg won my

Peratiiger, the foe of Brulfer, would not suffer me to

Therietzih peace, so passing Stuttgart‚ knowing Reuclzlin
there did dwell,

Heretilel by me suspected—ay! and dreaded‚ sooth to

T heri} to Tilbingen I journeyed—many ribald fellows
