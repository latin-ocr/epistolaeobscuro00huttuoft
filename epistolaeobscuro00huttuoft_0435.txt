But ‘⁴ nost1·o-tras·trare'’ is not in use, and is found neither
in the Vocabulary Ex Quo, nor in the Catholicon, nor in
the Breviloquus·‚ nor even in the Gemma gemmarum, not-
withstanding that this containeth many *terms of art.

Thereupon uprose Magister Andreas Delz'tzscle, a very
subtle scholar—on the one hand a Poet, and on the other,
an Artsman, Physician, and Jurist—who lectureth in
ordinary upon Ovid in his BletammpleSvS, and explaineth
all the fables allegorically and literally (I myself have
attended his lectures, by reason that his exposition is
mightily fundamental), and he lectureth privately on
Quintilian. and J avertens—and he held, in opposition to
Magister lVarmsemmel, that we should say “magister-
nostrandus ” ; for, as there is a difference between
“ magisternoster’' and ‘⁶ noster 1nagister‚'' so there is a
like difference between ‘⁶ magisternostrandus ’³ and ‘⁶ nos-
termagistrandus.'' Because “ magisternoster” signifieth
a Doctor of Divinity, and is one word, but ‘⁶ noster
magister'⁷ consisteth of two words, and is used for a
Master in any Liberal Science, whether it concern handi-
craft or braincraft. And it booteth not that “nostro-
tras-trare ’² is not in use, for we may devise new words——
and on this point he quoted Horace.

Then the company marvelled greatly at his subtilty,
and a tankard of Naumburg beer was handed to him.
Quoth he, ‘⁶ Now Ι wait awhile—but, With your leave l ’⁹
and, laughing heartily, he touched his cap and pledged
Master U'armsemmeI, saying, ‘⁶ Marry, Herr Magister,
think not that I am out with you !'' He made but one
draught of it, and bravely did Master Warmsemmel
respond thereto, for the honour of the Silesian ‘⁵ N ation.”

Then all the Magisters waxed merry, till at last the

bell rang to Vespers.
’“ Ι beseech your excellence, therefore, to set forth your
opinion, seeing that you are mightily profound, and, as Ι
said at the time, ‘⁶ Magister Ortwin will easily unfold the
truth of the matter, for he was my teacher at Deventer,
when I was in the third class.''

Let me know, too, how standeth the strife between
Doctor Jolzann Reuehlz'n and yourself. I have heard,
indeed, that the scoundrel, albeit a Doctor and a J urist,

will not yet recant.
