LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

who stood near could hear, saying, “Gentlemen, that
you may understand the true nature of this suit against
Jolnmn Reuclelin, let me tell you that the root of it
all is Jolzcmn chfferlrorn, who resembleth in name,
and in all else, that Johamz Pfeffirleorn who was in
this very place torn with red-hot pincers, and who
in like manner had become a pervert from his saith,
by reason of the wickedness that he had committed.
If Efefferlcorn were safe here in gaoL and the execu-
tioners were to put the question to him as to what
he had committed, he would make confession of not
a whit less than his namesake. He hath egged on
the Theologians at Cologne, and they have egged him
on in turn, and they would fain have burned all the
books of the Jews throughout Germany. And this,
that the Jews might come privily to the Theologians
and the aforesaid Ifffqfferlsorn with large sums of
money, beseeching them, and saying, ‘Leave us, we
pray you, our books—and lo, here are forty pieces
of gold1' Some JeWS, indeed, would have freely
given a hundred, and some, a thousand pieces. Then
came Reuelzlin and baulked their scheme, and they
were wrath with him. Hence they write books, and
try to defame him, and declare him to be a heretic.
Some books they write in Latin, and they publish
them under qufferlrorn’s name, whereas he is ignorant
even of the alphabet in Latin. This they do, since
they know full well that no man will reply, for none
will defile himself by touching such a scoundrel. It
is plain that if they were true Theologians—or even
honest men—they would do their own work, and not
shield and hide themselves behind that braggart. Other
books also they have published——some in the name of
Α νηοῖίί von Tongern, who hath been detected in forgery
—this no man can deny, nor can he himself declare
in his own defence that he is not a forger——it is known
throughout Germcmgs how he falsified the writings of
Johmm Reueleflessn. Another writer on behalf of the
Theologians is Magister Ortwin Gratius—the son of
a priest, and one who keepeth concubines and hath
been taken in advoutry. Then there is another scribe,
of whom you have heard much, Doctor W eigand W irtlz
