finite, indescribable, incomparable, ineffable thanks
——in that you hav e sent me Herr Johmm Pfijffml m 712’8
book which 15 intituled“ J ohann Pfeffe1k0rn’s Defence
against Calmn11ies.” I was so gladdened when Ι received
that book that Ι skipped for very Joy. I vei-ily believe
that Jolmnn chfferlcorn is he of whom Ezelciel pro-
phesied, Chap. ix„ saying, ‘⁶ And he called a man clothed
in linen, with a writer’s ink-horn by his side;” for
,Joleann quff'erlsorn ever hath a writer’s ink-horn with
him, and jotteth down citations and postils at Sermons
or in assemblieS, and afterwa1ds constiucteth his 1130-
13165. You rejoice me greatly when you send me his
books, for they are so craftily fabiicated that I marvel
thereat. I plume myself not a little at Viennam that
I am of his acquaintance· , and when I mention 111111,Ι
say, “ ιῙοΙιαηη. Pfigfferkorn, my friend.”

Nevertheless Ι have gathered from that book that
the Theologians are at variance concerning the Augen-
sz'egel—for some condemn it to the flames—for instance,
the Parisians and Colognese3 and others, to the rope—-
as did Doctor Peter Illeyer, who when he set eyes on
the Augempiegel, cried with a loud voice, “To the
gallow& 10 1116 gallows with such a book as this1’'
But you ought 10 be of one mind, and 111611 would
you gain the day against that heretic. Ι was greatly
alarmed when I read of these things, and I said, ·‘ Now
the Devil will hold the candle, if the Theologians fall
out ! ” But I trust you will once more agree together.
Nevertheless it 5661116111 to me that Doctor Peter and
his friends are not judicious in holding that the Augen-
,spz'egel should be hung on a gallows. For the book is
heretical, and being heretical, deserveth the stake.

Howbeit they may perchance contend that the Augen-
