moist places and hath a rank odour, as the Herbarius
teaeheth z the roots of this herb you must triturate with
the juice thereos, and therewith you must make a great
cataplasm, and cover his pauneh with it at the aecus-
tomed time, and he must lie upon his belly a full hour,
sweating profusely. And thus without a doubt his
colicky pains and tympanies will abate, for there is no
other medicament so effeetual as this for his distemper,
as has been proved in the ease of many patients. But
it will assuredly be proper for him first to take a
Ἰ cathartie of Album Graecum and radish juiee—four
drachms of each—and all will be well.”
Then came my mother, and gave me that 6011000-

And unless you do this, Herr Magister, Ι 311311 die,
and for grief my mother will die too.

NASMUCH as the Scripture saith, “The Lord
shall defend them who go simply,’' Ι greatly 00111-
mend your worthineSS, most argute Herr Magister, in
that you have opened your inmost heart to me so frankly,
and yet with a nice concinnity and a pretty trick in
Latinising. I, in like manner, will write to you eon-
gruously with the canons of Rhetoric, and not as a poet.
