with my studies, and never to weary of learning, but to
press forward, seeing that Ι had rare capacities, and
might, by God’s help, excel if I were fain.

You must know, then, that for the present I have
betaken myself to the University of Heidelberg, where
l am studying Theology. But Ι attend likewise a
daily lecture on PoetiCS, and in this art I am making,
by God's grace, notable progreSS.

Ι already know by rote all the fables of Ovid in his
Bletammplzoses, and these I can expound quadruply—
to wit, naturally, literally‚ historically, and spiritually—
and this is more than the secular poets can do.

Just now I asked one of those fellows whence
‘⁶ Mavors ’⁹ is derived. XVhereupon he put forth a
conjecture, but it was false.

Then I set him right, and told him that stlavors was

Jso named as being, so to speak, ‘⁶ mares vorans,” a man-

γ’ eater—and he was put to confusion.

cally by the N ine MuseS. And again he was at fault. ἔ
Then I told him that the Nine Muses signify the Seven Ξ

Thirdly, I asked him whence ‘⁶ Mercurius '⁹ is de- 3

rived. But he did not know, and Ι showed him that

Blere'zcrius was so named as being “ mercatorum curius '’

² Poets do but study their art literally, and do not com-
’ prehend allegorizing and spiritual expositions: as saith

ι, the Apostle‚ ‘⁶ The natural man receiveth not the things ξ..

ξ of the spirit of God.”

Now you may ask whence I have obtained this
subtle skill. I reply that I lately bought a book
composed by a certain English Doctor, of our Order,
Thomas of W ales by name; and this book is all writ
concerning Ovid’s ssletamovplzoses, explaining each story
allegorically and spiritually‚ and its profundity in
Theology passeth belief.

Most assuredly hath the Holy Spirit inspired this
man with so great learning, for in his book he setteth
forth the harmonies between the Holy Scriptures and
