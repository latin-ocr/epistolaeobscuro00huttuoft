1·11] CORNELIUS FENSTERMACHER

upon I was so wroth that 1 knew not how to reply.
Moreover they twitted me with having made pilgrimage
to Treves to see the holy coat, which they averred was
perchance not the Lord’s garment. This they would
fain prove by a dilemmatic syllogism, thus: “That
which is torn should not be shown as the Holy Coat,
but this is torn, therefore, &o.’' Thereupon Ι con-
ceded the major but denied the minor premiss. Then
they argued thus: ‘⁶ Saint Jerome saith, ‘ By its ancient
schism the Eastern Church hath rent in pieces the
Lord’s neat, woven without seam throughout.”’ But
Iretorted that Jerome's style differs from that of the
Evangelist, and is Ποῖ idiomatically apostolic. And, 30
saying, I arose from the table and left those windbagS.

You must know that so irreverently do these fellows
talk concerning the Magisters, that certainly and with-
out doubt they can be excommunicated therefor by
the Pope. If the authorities at Rome but heard of it
they would summon them to the Court, and confiscate
their benefices-—or, at the least, saddle thern with costs.
Who ever heard of such a thing as that mere students‚
neither graduated nor qualified in a single F aculty‚
should dare to calumniate men so exalted‚ so profoundly
immersed in all knowledge, as our Magisters Σ

I too have learned how to fashion theses and verses,
for I have been studying the ‘⁶ IVovum Latinum I dioma ’'
of Magister Lorenz Habe, and Isolzlburger’s Grammar,
and Valerius Maoez'mus, and other poets. And as I
went along I just now constructed a metrical composi-
tion against those rascals. It followeth :—

In BIayence town there standeth

a hostel cleped Corona,
And there I lay, the other day,

in propria persona,
But two buffoons, irreverent loons,

’gainst Doctors of Theology
Began to bray, though graduates they

not even in Philosophy!
Unknown to them the solemn disputation,
And multifold corollary formation
From one small “ ergo '’ : as Dans Scotus taught—
(Who seorns him to confusion will be brought)—
Unknown the Quodlibets of Alexander,
Of all the foes of learning a withstander;
