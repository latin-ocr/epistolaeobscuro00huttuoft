I could weep tears of blood, so greatly do Ι grieve!
Wsho that hears such things will study Theology any kb
more, or show the Doctors of Divinity condign reverence?
All folk will believe that Doctor Reuclclin hath more
learning than the Divines ε though this is impossible.

It is reported too, that after three months a final
decree against the Doctors will issue ; and that the Pope
will command, under pain of the severest censure, that
the friars of the Order ofPreaclzers, shall on account of
their insolence, wear, in white, upon the back of their
black mantles, a pair of spectacles‚ or barnacles, in
perpetual memorial, to their shame, of their having
wi ought ill to the E seglass of Herr J olzamz Reuehlin, as
they are also held to be disgraced on account of the
poisoning of some Emperor or other during the cele-
bration of mass.

But I hope the Pope will not be such a noddy as to
do this; if he doth, we must everywhere throughout our
Order, recite against him the Psalm ‘⁵ Deus, laudem.”

The Fathers and Doctors are pondering how to
stave off this calamity. They purpose to seek from
the Apostolic See plenary indulgences‚ and to collect
great store of money in Germmzy and Frcwzce, and by}k
this means to hold out against that abettor of the Jews, s
until he die—for he is an old man. And then they
will totally damn him.

Farewell‚ give counsel to the extent of your ability,
and labour for the good of our Order.
