with pungent wit to show monkish dissoluteness its own
sordid image.

And even so, the authors of the Epistolae apply the
caustic of their contempt with gentleness and modera-
tion. To quote again the words of a late eminent
historian: ‘⁶ The Obscure Men are not wicked or
vicious: they have their frailties and they fall before
their temptations; but they do not rejoice in wrong-
doing, and they feel remorse for their sins. They tell
with brutal frankness the tales of their commonplace
amours; but they are not hypocrites, and do not con·
ceal their weakness.” ¹

No, they were not hypocrites, as later generations
learned to understand the word. We have but to
compare the summer lightning that plays about the
head of ‘⁶ M aster C onrad of Z wickau '' with the thunder-
bolt cast by Burns at ‘⁶ Holy Willie ” to realise the vast
and suggestive difference. Both are ‘⁶ fashed ’' with the
same failing-but while Conrad prattles of his lawless
amours‚ he seeks to palliate them by the example
of better men than himself, Samson and Solomon‚ to
wit ; and it is left to Holy Willie to scale the sublime

heights of more modern hypocrisy‚ and cry 2

“ Maybe thou lets this fleshly thorn
Beset thy servant e'en and morn,
Lest he owre high and proud should turn,
'Cause he's sae gifted ;
If sae, thy han' maun e’en be borne
Until thou list it.’'

The charge we have commented on can at all events
be appreciated, even by those who do not sympathise
with it, but another accusation seems inexplicable—
except as an illustration of the liability of the edge of
Satire’s weapon to be turned when it is too keenly set:
we mean the preposterous charge of blasphemy. ‘⁶ Pre-
posterous '³ is surely not too strong a term to use when
a writer who dared to show how the mysteries of a
venerable religion were being smirched by ignoble and
ridiculous associations‚ and who sought to rescue them
from the mire, is branded as a blasphemer.

No better instance of this line of criticism could
