LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

all wicked books, and especially those works of the
New Theologians which are not founded upon the
Angelic Doctor, the Subtle Doctor, the Seraphic
Doctor, or St. Thomas Aquinas. This would without
doubt have been praiseworthy and highly profitable;
and I believe the time will yet come—which may the
Omnipotent grant who reigneth through all, and above
all, and for ever. Amen.

Ιὶ EGBERT THE NAMELESS to Ilsagister
Orth'n Gratius greetz'ng

ENERABLE Sir, who art mine own familiar

friend 1 for a long while Ι have found no convenient
messenger by whom I could transmit letters to your
worship, or long ago I would have written to you.

Grant me forgiveness therefore, for gladly would Ι
have written to you if Ι could but have found a
messenger.

But since you have written to inform me that
Doctor V (demin von Gelterslzelm asked you to let me
know that I still owe him two florins, for lectures when
I resided in his hostel, you may tell him I will not pay
him a penny. For he promised me all manner of
things, and told me he would give me a bouncing
gratuity if Ι would go twice or thrice a day to the
Rhine wharf, and Scan the boats coming up or down
the stream, see if any sreshmen were in them, and
persuade them to come and lodge at his hostel. And,
by the Lord, Ι netted for him twenty yellow-beaks at
the least, and l lost no end of time in running hither
and thither, when I ought to have been studying. >

But the Doctor never gave me anything, except
what he gave us all—sorry commons, meagre meat,
and sour drink. Bid him bear that in mind.

But fare ye well, in all affection.
