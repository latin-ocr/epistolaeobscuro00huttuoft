PRE FACE

puts it, “they have dropped out of the reading of the
average educated man ’'—adding‚ suggestively, “he
cannot too soon return to them.”

The notes in the present volume are mainly intended
for readers who have made no special study of the
period involved. They are largely devoted to some
account of men and matters that will be sought for in
vain in ordinary English books of reference. A list of
works consulted in their preparation would be lengthy,
but is unnecessary—for where the search was fruitful
the note in most cases records the fact.

One acknowledgment of indebtedness must, how-
ever, explicitly be made. The supplementary volumes
of Bocking's monumental edition of Ulrich von Hutten’s
works (Leipsic‚ 1863-9>‚ form a vast quarry of sugges-
tive information in which every labourer in this field
perforce must delve. It is not too much to say that
without such an aid the labour of which the present
volume is the outcome would never have been under-
taken. Certain inevitable contributions levied upon
Bocking's stores have, however, been largely supple-
mented by references to more recent and accessible
sources—to English and French, as well as German
authorities—and to discoveries that have considerably
modified opinions justifiably held forty years ago. Every
quoted authority has, with scarcely an exception, been
directly consulted, and researches by the present writer
among the incunabula of the British Museuin have
constituted not the least agreeable portion of his
task.

A few words on the English rendering seem desir-
able—an apology from the translator may even be
expected—for it seems to be the almost invariable
practice of modern writers, when mentioning the Epis-
tolae, to add a remark to the effect that “they are
quite untranslatable.'’ The phrase is not free from
ambiguity, but in a certain sense the observation is
doubtless just.

It is probably impossible to devise a dog-English
that would suggest the delightful dog-Latin of the
original, without at the same time modernising and
vulgarising the whole atmosphere of the Satire: and
