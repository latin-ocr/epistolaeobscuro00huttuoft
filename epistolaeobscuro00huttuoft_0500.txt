ξ of Laws at Leipsic. But this Ι credit not, for he even
ξ goadeth Magisters 1n Leipsic, to wit, Hundt senior and
a Hzmdt junior, and many others, who are much the
l3 apter to goad him than he 1s to goad them3 but they

to the precept of the Apostle,6 ‘Kick not against the
goads.’' Nevertheless it is meet for thee to goad him
in return, for thou hast a fine intellect and art a cunning
deviser, and m a single hour thou canst contrive metrical
goads, and canst goad him concerning all his words and
, deeds. Ι have put together a t1 aetate against him

³ goad me in return, Ι will goad him again the more

’ sharply.

In haste, from STRASBURG‚ at the house of Blattlzew Sclziirer.

Poetry from your worthiness at Cologm, where you
oveltop all others 111 that art, for you are a Poet much

moieover expound Plz'ms and Greek Grammar.
In all confidence, ther‚efore I desire to disclose some-
