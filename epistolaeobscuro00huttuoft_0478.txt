LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

only fit for the jakes‚ and that the Friars themselves
were a pack of jack—puddings, who deceived women and
churls. Then cried Ι, “ To the stake‚ to the stake with
such a heretic 1''

But he laughed in my face. Then said 1, “Τ11011
133631, if thou shouldest but say such things in the ears
of Doctor Hoogstmten of Cologne, the inquisitor of
Heretical Pravity ! '' Quoth 116, “ Hoogstraten is a vile
and damnable beast‚’' and thereupon he railed against
him, and said ‘⁶ Jolzann Reuelzlin is an upright man, but
the theologians are devils, and unjustly have they given
sentence that his book, the Augenspiegel should be
burned.”

Then I answered, “Say not so, for it is written
in the eighth chapter of Ecclesiasticsuts·: ‘Deem thou
not against the judge‚ for after that is righteous he
deemeth.⁷ Knowest thou not that the University
of Paris, where the theologians are learned and
zealous and cannot err, hath decided as Cologue hath?
Wherefore wilt thou fight against the universal
Church?” Then he averred that the theologians
of Paris were unjust judgeS‚ and that they took
from the Predicant Friars a bribe which—so the
lying rascal said—was conveyed to them by that most
zealous and learned man Heri· Theodorei· 1·οη Gauda,
legate of the University of Cologne„ Moreover he
swore that the church I spake of was not God’s
Church‚ but that of which the Psalmist spake, “ Ι 113176
hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not sit
with the wicked.’' And he reviled the Doctors of Paris
for all that they did; saying that the University of
Paris was the mother of 311 foolishness, which, taking
there its rise, spread into Germangy and Italy, and that
that University sowed broadcast superstition and folly.
He said too that, as 3 11116, 311 students of Paris were
wrong—headed and in a manner numskulls. In conclu-
sion he declared the 'l'almud not to be under the ban of
the Church. Then Doctor Peter Bleyer, parish priest of
Frankfort, who was seated hard by, said, ‘⁶ I will prove
to you that this fellow is no good Christian and holdeth
not with the opinion of the Church. Bw! you

fellows talk much about theology‚ and now nothing.
