Eleven writers regarded them as the joint pro—
duction of two 01· three pens-half-a-dozen possible
combinations being suggested. Eleven other critics
contended that the satire was the work of from six
to sixteen authors acting in collaboration. They allow
us to make our choice from ten different groups.

While giving a glimpse of this critical chaos we
have, however, no intention of involving the reader
in its perplexities. It may be said at once that we
are to-day practically certain that the Epistolae were
the actual work of two men, but that they reflect the
feelings and ideas of a coterie, or——if that term be
