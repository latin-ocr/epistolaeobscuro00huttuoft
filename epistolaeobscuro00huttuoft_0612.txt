LETTERS OF OBSOURE MEN

Faculty. Joliamz Rem-lilim is a foe to the Theologians ;
Magister-noster Peter is a Theologian3 therefore—ete.
And for a man to defend his Faculty is a thing most
permissible. Even Herr Just-ol) van Hoogstmten‚
Magister-noster and Inquisitor of Heretical Pravsty,
has met with no good fortune in the Cause of the
Faith. The Curialists now all desire to be thought
Poets, and hence they belittle the Theologians and
withstand them. And yet Ι trust it will profit them
but little3 for the Lord will look upon his servants and
deliver them.

Ι lately heard that the Emperor hath sent a letter
to the Pope on J0hann Reuclelz‘n’s· behalf, and that
he wrote in the sense that if his Holiness doth not
speedily make an end of the business, and pronounce
judgment, he will himself take steps to defend his
Counsellor. But what boots it? If the Pope is on
the side of the Theologian& I have no fear. A man of

. weight, an officer of the Curia, said to me, “ Wshat care

we for these letters? If Rem-lelin hath any money,
let him send it hither. In the Curia one must have

, money, or naught goeth forward.”

Another officer hath told me privily that Magister-
noster ‚Jalsoh hath again given donatives to certain
referendaries. Hence it cometh to pass that when
they meet him they greet him with respect, and con-
verse with him in friendly wise. Now therefore we are
the more hopeful. If I miss the benefice, then Ι shall
aim at the vicarage in IVeuss that you wot of. My
proctor hath told me that my claim is good. Ι have
heard that news hath lately come hither that the
University of Evficrt intendeth to withdraw its judg-
ment, or decision, against Johmm Reuelzslin. If this be
sooth, I declare all the Theologians there to be liars
and traitors‚ and Ι shall ever hold it a scandal that they
abide not by their own F aculty, and defend not that
most zealous man Herr Jalcol) van Hoogstraten, who
is the light of Theology‚ and shineth like a star by
reason of his doctrines and arguments on behalf of the
Catholic Faith. As a Theologian he hath no peer.
Lately he disputed here, very learnedly, in the Sapz'enza.
thereupon a certain Italian said, ‘⁶ Ι knew not that
