LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Thereupon he read the mandate, and said:

“ Ι cannot see that aught is decreed herein save
that the Augerwpiegel is not to be sold publicly until
the charge is heard and decided. It doth not appear
that Reuclclz'n is pronounced a heretic.⁷’ I answered
that this might be piously presumed from the fact that
the sale of his book was banned, and Ι asked him to
espouse our Cause from the pulpit. He made answer‚
⁴⁶ I pray thee leave me in peace: Ι am here to spread
the word of God, and to offend no man. For it is
written, ‘But whoso slandereth one of these small‚’
etc, ;'' and so I could not bring it about that he should
aid the Cause of the Faith.

On another occasion Ι observed that when Brother
‹Icckob of our Order was here, and distributed the in-
dulgences that we had procured at Rome for the
Monastery at Augsbmxg, he also asked the aforesaid
Doctor Reiss to extol the Indulgences in the pulpit,
and exhort women, and otherS‚ so that money might
flow into the chest, for it would be well spent. But
he neglected to say what was required, and would
not even utter a single word concerning Indulgences.
Thereupon Brother Jalcoh said to him, “Lo, you
grudge our collecting money3 yet collect it we will,
if it should break your heart;” and from the pulpit
he cried, “Lo, here you have indulgences, and letters
of indulgence, and that which is written in them is
as true and credible as the Gospel; and when you
receive these indulgences, you are as surely shriven
as though Christ had come hither and shriven you
himself.” Then Doctor Reiss argued to the contrary,
and said :

“Naught can be evened with the Gospe13 and it
will go well with him who doeth well. If a man
receiveth those indulgences a hundred times over, and
yet liveth not uprightly, he shall perish3 nor shall
the indulgence profit him. But, on the other hand,
if a man liveth righteously, or, after sinning repenteth
and amendeth his ways, Ι tell you that he will be an
inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven, and will need
no other helpe1·.’' And hence it hath entered my mind
that this Doctor Reiss is an enemy of the Regulars:
