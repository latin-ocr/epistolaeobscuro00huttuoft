me, and will say, ‘How haughty the fellow is! lie
deigns not to send me a reply.”'

therefore l beseech your Reverence to hold me
blameless‚ and to know of a certainty that the matter
standeth not thus.

You thought, forsooth, that Ι abode still at Cas-sel, but
mine host there, when he received the letter, forwarded
it to ine at sslarburg, and thus much time was spent.
For I am at present at sslarburg, and am grounding two
young men of quality. then, therefore, you send me
a letter, prithee address it hither. Ι gather that you
are busy composing a notable treatise, and that you
intend to send it to the printers, but deem it better
to entitle it “Johann Pfefferkorn's Defence against
Calumnies.” You tell me that you shall not put your
name to this, but shall attribute it to J. Ρ., inasmuch
as Pfqfferlrorn, since he heeds not such things, has no
sear of Jolemm Reuclzlin and his compliceS, should
they take it into their heads to concoct a rejoinder.
But I would fain put this question to you: What an
if Reuclzlin should say, “Marry! Pfefferlcorn hath no
Latin, so he could not have written this: it is the
Theologians of Cologwe and that poet of theirs‚ Ortwin,
who compose these lampoons, and then say ‘Pfeffer-
horn wrote them, not we ! ' '’

Ι trust therefore that you will take much thought
before you do this. If you were afterwards to deny
the authorship‚ Reuclclin might recognize your style
and prove that you wrote the book, and then you would
be drawn into a scandal.

Forgive me, for I write but out of affection. Fare-
well.
