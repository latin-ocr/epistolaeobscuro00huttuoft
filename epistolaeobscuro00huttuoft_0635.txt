intentioris. Again, the Albertists hold that a mobile
body in vacuo moveth continuously, but the Thomists
hold that a mobile body in vacuo moveth instantly.
Again‚ the Albertists say that the Milky Way is
celestial in its nature, but the Thomists say that it is
elemental. Yet it matters not much with which side
a man holdeth, so long as he followeth the ancient
ways. Ι desire that this young man should have his
commons in the hostel, and that he should be kept
under striet control and not permitted to run wild
wheresoever he willeth. And when he transgresseth,
chastise him. For it is written in the Book of Pro-
verbs, Chap. xxii. τ “ W ithhold not correction from the
child ; for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not
die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod and deliver his
soul from hell.'' Induce in him the habit of joining in
the disputations of the hostel, and take heed that he
attendeth not the lectures of Caesarius, or other poets.
I rejoieed when you told me that Buscln'us no longer
abideth at Cologne, for he was a stumbling-bloek to
the University, enticing students away with that poetry
of his. There are two Poets here—Eobcm. Hesse and
Peter Aperbaclc, who are enemies of mine, but Ι pay
no heed to them. Whenever they see me they fall to
talking about Jolmom Reuclzlin's case, making him out
to be in the right, and defaming the Theologians. But
Ι hold my tongue——though a little while ago I did say,
“Jolzaom Pfssffkrkvm knows right well what to eall
him,” and I shewed them that book of his called
“J. P.’s Defence against Slanders‚” and with that Ι
took myself off. God grant that the judgment may
go in your favour, or else these poets will laugh us to
scorn. And now I commend the young man to your
charge. Farewell.
