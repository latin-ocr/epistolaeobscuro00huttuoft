³⁸ Thomas de I‘Valleis: the book
here referred to is: Metamor-
phosis Ovidiana moraliter a Mayistro
Thoma Walleys Anylico de profes·—
sione Predicatorum sul» sanctissimo
patre Domiuieo emplanata. The first
edition of this was printed in 1509,
and with the text of Ovid, at Lycus,
in 1510.

Thomas (le Walleis, or lVallensis
(ἐφ’. “the Welshman ”), has been con-
fused with Thomas Jorz, or Joyce
(“Thomas the Englishman''), John
Wlxllensis, and suudry other real and
imaginary personages. (3f, D. N. B.‚
Arts. “ wallensis '' and ‘⁴ .101·z.’⁷

however, by J. B. llaureau (Aemldmie
des Inscriptions et Helles Letters, tom.
xxx. pp. 45-55, 1883), that Thomas
VVallensis had nothing to ‹lo with the
work printed under his name. M.
Haureau confidently traces the work
to Petrus Ber-cherius (or Bercharius),
z'.e. Pierre Bersuire (Bercheur‚ οι·
Bcrchoire), a Franciscan monk, who
afterwards, like Rabelais‚ became a
Benedictine.

l‘ierre Bersuire, ob. 1362, was
born near the village of Bressuire
(anciently Bersuirc). “ He compiled an
elaborate Biblical Encyclopaedia, and
translated Livy.

⁵⁰ (Ie Saturno. The “four-fold”
mode of interpreting the Metamor-
phoses, adopted by “Thom. Wall.,”
may be illustrated under this head :—

(Literalz'ter) : ‘⁶ Saturn is said to
devour his own som, because a person
born under the ‘ constellation’ of
Saturn rarely lives.”

(Naturaliter) : “ Saturn devours his
own sons, because he signifies Time,
and whatsoever is born of Time is by
Time wasted and consume‹l.”

(Historialiter) : “ Saturn was King
of Crete, of whom his brother Titan
predicted that one of his sons would
drive him from the throne. W'here-
upon he determined to devour his
sons and avert the evil fate.” He
swallowed Juno, Neptune, and Pluto ;
but Jupiter, his son by Cybele, drove
him from his kingdom.

(Allo-qoriee) : “An avaricious man,
armed with rapine as with a scythe,
devours his children, in the sense that
by his extortions he impoverishes
them and consumes their substance.”
Then follows the quotation from Ez.
v. 10, given in the text. Met. Ov.
