you must take a new glazed pot full of water, and
having kindled a fire in a room closed in all partS, you
must make fumigation with incense, and light a candle
made of new wax with which a morsel of a Paschal
candle has been mingled. Then you must pronounce
this incantation over the image: “I conjure you, by
the virtue of the Almighty, by the Nine Choirs of
Angels, by the virtue of Cosdriel, Boldriach‚ 'l¹o1·nach‚
Lissiel, Farnach, Pitrax, and Starniel, that you set
before me, in her proper substance and corporeality,
Barbara daughter of Elsa, to submit herself to me in
all things in accordance with my will.’'

Then you must write these names around the head
of the image with a silver style: Astrob÷Arnod÷
Bildron÷Sydra÷‚ and forthwith place it in the pot
of water, and set it by the fire, uttering this conjura-
tion: “I charge thee, Barbara daughter of Elsa, by
the power of the Almighty, by the nine Choirs of the
Angels‚ by the power of Cosdriel, Boldriach‚ Tornaeh,
Lissiel, Farnach, Pitrax‚ and Starniel, and by the power
of those names, Astrob‚ Arnod, Bildron‚ Sydra, that
thou instantly conceive such love for me, that without
tarrying thou wilt come to me, because I languish in
love.” Thereupon‚ so soon as the water becometh hot,
all is accomplished‚ for she will begin to love you to
such a degree, that when she sees you not—she knows
not where you are.

This has been proved oftentimes, and never fails.
Believe me, this is very precious lore. Ι would not
unfold it to you were it not that I love you so fervently ς
and, for once, you might in turn communicate a secret
to me.

May you abide sound in health.
