11. 16] JOHANN HUTER

graph into ten parts, and it runneth after the fashion
of a dialogue—and as for its latinity‚ it is hugely
elegant. I cannot tell you how useful it is to have
a book like that.

But you must not blab to those Jurists in Cologne
who are on Jolmmz Reaclclin’s side, for if they had that
book they could praetise the more subtilly.

I know very well that you commend not my study-
ing Law, because you have often told me that I ought
the rather to study Theology‚ which giveth a blessing,
and is of higher desert than the Jurisprudenee which
maketh the erooked straight and the straight crooked—
and you cited a passage in Rielzarclus. N evertheless I
say unto you that it is my duty, inasmueh as the
seience of Jurisprudenee toucheth the earning of our

bread‚ as it is written :—

“ Con well ,Justiuian's code, if pelf you’ld gain,
And Galen : chaff all else, but they the grain.’'

Moreover you know right well that I am a poor man3
and my mother has written to tell me that I must
bestir myself to get cheer and gear, because she will
not send me another stiver—and‚ by the Lord, that’s
how it standeth.

And now again I bethink myself of that fellow who
hath so mightily stirred my eholer. From my beart,

fare ye well.

Roma.
