1. 22] GERHARD SOI-IIRRUGE L

Rem-Idm even doth not know where it is written that
the Talmud is a forbidden book.''
‘⁶ And where is it written. 2 '’ ‘isked the fellow.
Then Doctor Peter told him that it w ι5 written in
“The Γ (1)·’.κ17655 o] Faitlzs⁷ Then the braggart made
answer that“ The Fmfftmszs of Faitlffl was a dung- hill
book, and of no account, and that none sav 6 a ninny oi
a dunce cited that book. l¹hen Ι was overcome with
fear, for Doctor Peter was so wroth that his hands
trembled, and Ι feared lest he should do the fellow an
injury, but Ι said to him, “Good Sir, prithee have
patience, for ‘W ho is patient is governed with much
wisdom.'—Pr0verbs- cviii. Let him alone and he will
perish like the dust before the wind. He speaketh
much, yet knoweth nothing. As it is written in Eccle-
&instit-27& ‘A fool multiplieth words, ’ so doth he. '’ And
then, oh shame! the fellow began to say many things
against the Ο) (1⁷67 os P7eaclee7s—how that those pious
friars did a deed of wickedness at Bm ηε that Ι would
not credit to save my life—how that they were burned
at the stake—and how that the P7 ectelze7s once mingled
poison in the Euchalistic Sacrament and thus muldered
an Emperor. He declared that the whole Order should
be blotted out—for otherwise great scandals would be
caused 111 the Church‚ since from that Ο1ᾶ61· proceedeth
all malice——and many other Such like things he said.
Know then of a truth that Ι earnestly desire to return
to Cologne, for what can Ι do among such accursed men
as these. ἲ “May death come upon them, and may they
go down alive into the pit,” as saith the Psalmzs,t for
they are sons of Belial.1f it seemeth good to yon, Ι
will fir st of all take my degree—but if not, I will depart
immediately. Speedily therefore send me your opinion:
therewith will I be governed. And now I commend
you to the Lord. Farewell.
