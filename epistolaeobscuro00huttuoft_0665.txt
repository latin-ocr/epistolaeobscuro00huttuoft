gone by when a Magister went to the baths more pupils
would follow him than now go to the Church on a
Festival. Moreover, students then were as decorous
as so many angels; but now they run wild, and pay
no heed to the Magiste1·s; and they are all minded to
dwell in the Town. and to have their meals without
the Hostels‚ and the Magisters have very few boarders.
On the last degree-day only ten bachelors graduated3
and when we held the examination the Magisters had
some talk of rejecting certain candidates, Then cried
I, ‘⁶ Heaven forbid! for if we reject a single student,
hereafter not a soul will come forward for examina-
tion, or even study for the degree—they will all be
off to the poetS.’' And so we made shift to let them
pass. We found grounds of dispensation under three
heads. First, with regard to age: for it is ordained
that a graduating bachelor must be at least sixteen
years of age, and Magisters‚ twenty. Yet, if they be
not of full age, a dispensation may be granted.
SecondIy, there is dispensatory power in the matter
of conduct. For if undergraduates have not shown
sufficient respect to M agisters and graduates, they must
be rejected—-unless admitted by dispensation. And
with this view inquiry is made concerning their tres-
passes3 whether they have been uncivil in the streets,
or have consol-ted with harlots, or have borne arms, or
have thou'd a Magister or a priest, or have made a dis-
turbance at lecture, or in a hostel. Thirdly‚ there is a
dispensation in Liberal Arts, when candidates are ill—
conversant with their subjects‚ and have not fulfilled
the prescribed conditions. A little while ago, during
an examination, I asked such an one, “Tell me, how
cometh it that you answer nothing? ” He replied that
it was because he was ‘⁶ so fearsome.” ‘⁶ Nay,” said I,
‘⁶ Ι trow that it is not so fearsome, but so dulsome‚ that
you are.” Then he cried, “Nay, by the Lord‚ Herr
Magister—I have store of knowledge within me, but it
won’t come out l” Thereupon I gave him dispensation.
It is manifest, then, that the Universities will be
sore losers. The other day I questioned a student
about some transgression—straightway he turned upon
me and thou’d me l Then said I, ‘⁵ I will store that up
