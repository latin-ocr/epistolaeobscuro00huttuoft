INTRODUCTION

Erasmus a poem entitled ‘⁶ The T riumph of Reuchlin ”
——Trz‘umplcus Capm'onis-and it appears that Erasmus
had advised its being withheld for a time. A poem
with the same title appeared in 1518, under the pseu-
donym of ‘⁶ Eleutherius Byzenus”; it may be briefly
described as a savage onslaught upon all Reuchlin's
foes, and of this it seems certain that Hutten was the
author—or, at all eventS‚ an author. The list of verbal
coincidences collected by Hamilton appears in itself
sufficient to establish this. It is true that a difficulty
is introduced by the fact that Mutiarr-a-lso saw in 1514
a ‘⁶ Triumph of Reuchlin'' by ‘⁶ Accius Neobius‚’' and
this he attributes to Hermann von dem Busche. There
can be little doubt that the two documents were drafts
of one and the same poem (the change of pseudonym
is clearly unimportant)‚ and it is of course by no means
improbable that Buschius as well as Hutten had a
hand in it. In the twenty-fifth letter of the first
series of the Epistolae it is plainly stated that ‘⁶ unus
(poeta) jam composuit unum librum qui vocatur
Triumphus Capnionis, et continet multa scandala de
vobis.'' It is to be observed that the poem is here
merely spoken of as “composed‚'’ not printed or pub-
lished, and, as we have seen, it did not appear until
three years later. The somewhat tangled chain of cir-
cumstances connected with the Triumphus at any rate
tends to illustrate the fact that the German humanists
of the day kept in touch with one another on the sub-
ject of the great controversy which so keenly interested
them, and that their manuscripts were freely handed
about, whether for criticism or mutual admiration.

The actual authors of the Epistolae accordingly
stand before us to-day in the persons of Crotus
Rubianus and Ulrich von Hutten. These are the
names'‘*fflffifflmi1ton ‘ffiffleniore than probable in
1831, and that Brecht in 1904 made, as far as cir-
cumstances permit, a certainty.

The latter writer has spared no pains in dealing
with the abundant materials at his disposal. He has
critically dissected known writings of Crotus and
Hutten and has laid them side by side with the Epis-
tolae: in his enthusiasm he has never hesitated to
