those ‘ lees’—that is, sweeping away the sophistrieS‚
and the false and darkening commentaries of Theology,
shall bring their ‘candles' and cast light upon the
Scriptures‚ and give us once more the primitive and
true Theology; in like manner as the aforesaid Erasmus,
for example, hath lately emended the works of St. Jerome
and caused them to be imprinted. He hath emended
the New Testament also, and this, I take it, is of more
profit than if twenty thousand Scotists and Thomists
were to wrangle for a hundred years concerning Entity
and Essence.” Now, when he had made an end of
speaking, I cried, “God preserve me! Wfliat do I
hear? You are de facto excommunicatel'’ and Ι
would fain have left him. But he detained me, saying‚
‘⁶ Hear yet the conclusion of the matter.” ‘⁶ Ι will not

Peter of Ravenna and Joleaom Reucldz'n——desiring to
brand them as heretics by reason of their learning and
their renown which they envy. And since they perceive
that they cannot do such mighty works as those most
learned men, they would fain destroy them. These
then are the ⁶ ravening wolves ’ who lie in wait against
the repute and the very lives of the innocent. And
now for seven years have they on all sides harassed and
maltreated Johamz Remmia, that poor old man, and
unless the Almighty had averted their wickedness, they
would have altogether destroyed him. It cannot be
alleged that Reuclclz‘n himself is a ravening wolf, for in
all his life he hath ravaged no one, that is he hath
