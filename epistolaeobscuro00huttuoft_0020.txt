PREFACE

here no attempt to do anything of the kind has been
made. A standard of translation, however, which insists
on a reflection not only of the thoughts of the writer
but of the vehicle in which he conveys them, is, to say
the least, an exacting one, and has seldom been attained.
As Charles Lamb has observed, ‘⁶ W ords involving
notions, are hard enough to render: it is too much to
expect us to translate a sound, and give an elegant
version to a jingle.'' From the further implicafflon, how-
ever, that the humour and satiric force of the Epistolae
Obscurorum Virorum depend mainly on the droll vile-
ness of their Latinity‚ the present writer must emphatic-
ally dissent. On the contrary, he is of opinion that the
edge of the satire could not wholly be blunted even by
the crudest translation. Yorick, we may be sure, did
not doff his infinite jest and excellent fancy with his
motley, and the comic ineptitudes of the “Obscure
Men ’⁷ are not solely involved in the verbal trappings
of their Letters .· their satiric foolishness is of their very
essence--though we bray them in a mortar yet will it
not depart from them.

There is, indeed, good reason to believe that the
canine Latin in question is, after all, no very extrava-
gant caricature of the ‘⁶ pseudo-vernacular '³ of the day,
and that it appears far more ludicrous in our eyes than
it did to contemporaries.

But the narrow bounds of a Preface are not suitable
lists for a controversy. The translator will be content
if his rendering is regarded as a mere device for re-
lieving the notes of a good deal of exegetical matter:
he has aimed at making it close rather than literal, for
it is a curious fact—not, however, incapable of ex-
planation—that a word-for-word translation would
frequently have the effect of converting phrases of
medieval na'i‘vete into quite modern vulgar-isms.

It is, however, not impossible that, with some, ‘⁶ un—
translatable” may mean “ill-suited for translation in
any form.” This is a point on which it is surely need-
less to dwell at any length. The authors, to use Bishop
Creighton's words, “Created their puppets and pulled
their strings with all the heedlessness of rollicking and
unchastened drollery;'' and it was the drollery of the
