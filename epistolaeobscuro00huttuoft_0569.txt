(I JODOCL'S SCHNEIDER to
sslag. Ortwin Gratius

ALUTATIONS unending‚ and a New Year full of
as good fortune as there is to be found on earth—
nay, more if possible—I wish your worship. You must
know that I am prospering, by the grace of God who
hath granted me His mercy, and, as the Rs·almz'.s·t saith,

“Azbge7zspiegel.’' Prithee, send me this Commentary
when it is completed. I trow that, without doubt, it
will be a miracle of art—expounding all the argumentS,
and notabilia, and propositions, and conclusions, and
