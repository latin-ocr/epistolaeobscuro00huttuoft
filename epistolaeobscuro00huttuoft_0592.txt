LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

resolved‚ therefore, to return to the fatherland. Ι, to
curry-eomb a mule and mundify a stable! The Devil
run away with the stable and the mule 1 Ι verily believe
it would be flying in the face of the Statutes of the
University! For a Magister must needs eomport
himself as a Magister. It would be a scandalous thing
for a Master of Arts of Cologne to do such drudgery.
Nay‚ for the honour of the University Ι will return to
the fatherland.

Rome moreover pleaseth me not in other ways.
You would not believe how arrogant are the Clerks
and Curialists. One of them said but yesterday that
he would besquatter a Cologne Magister. “ Besquatter

e

a Magister is terrible in the sight of his discipleS.
Thirdly‚ from magis and theron (that is, rank), for a
Magister is of higher rank than his discipleS. Fourthly‚

1 from Magis and sedere, sor a magister ever sitteth in a

¹³1 higher room than any of his diseiples.⁷’

Then quoth he, “ What is your authority?” I
answered that Ι had read all this in the V ademeeum.
