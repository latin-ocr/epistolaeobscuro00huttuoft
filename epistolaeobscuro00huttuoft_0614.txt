yet they knew all things; and so we may suppose that
the Holy Spirit can instil into the aforesaid Jolzann
Efeffbrkorn all the knowledge of the Saints, as saith the
Scripture.) Y ou also name two Magister-nosters in
fisains—Heri· Bartlzolomew Zelzetzder, preacher in the
Cathedral, and Herr Peter Bertram the pastor3 as well
as, in Frcmlffoff, Herr Peter ssleyer, who excellet-h in
his sermons, and maketh folk laugh or weep as he willeth,
and by his preaching worketh miracles.

Now therefore, having due regard to all these, Ι
would that you all put your shoulders to the wheel to
prevail over those Jurists and profane Poets—or impose
silence upon them, so that they should no longer ven-
ture to write books: or, at least, if they would fain be
at botching something together, let them first submit
it to the Magister-nosters to decide if it may be printed.
And if it meeteth not with the approval of the Magister-
nosters let it not be printed—or let it be burnt. The
Magister-nosters ought also to issue a mandate that no
jurist or poet should write anything concerning Theo-
logy, nor drag this new Latin of theirs into holy Theo-
logy-as hath J olmnfn Revcclclin, and, Ι am told, another
fellow, Proverbia Erasmi by name—for they are not
grounded in that Science‚ and 'tis likely that they have
never debated publickly, nor held syllogistic disputation
thereon, according to precedent. They would ever be
putting their sickles into other men's corn—and this the
Theologians should by no means suffer.

I beseech you, therefore, to urge these mightily
learned men of whom you speak, to dispute against
these new-fangled Latinisers and dust their doublets
soundly. If they make boast that they know Greek
and Hebrew‚ tell them that Theologians have naught
to do with such tongues. Holy Scripture hath been
sufficiently translated, and we have no need of any
other renderings. Furthermore, it is not meet that we
should learn such tongues, lest we bring upon us the
contempt of Jews and Greeks. When the Jews see
that we learn their tongue, they say, “Lo‚ the Chris-
tians study our sciences‚ and without them they cannot
defend their own faith;'' and thereby Christians are

deeply humiliated, and tkssglews are strengthened in
