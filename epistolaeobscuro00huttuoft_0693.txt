ALUTATIONS infinite and eternal. Beloved

Jolzcmn, you lately sent me news that was but ill
hearing—to wit that Jolzann Reuelzlz'n hath gained for
himself great renown among those Poets of his by
writing a book intituled “Gabellistica‚'’ or “Gabala‚’'
and that he is in high favour with the Pope. I would
fain know what ‘⁶ Gabala ’' may mean, but though I
have long sought for it in my Catlzolicon and Gemma
Gemmarum, as well as in Briton, I cannot discover its
signification. I addressed a letter thereon to Magister
Ortwin, but he hath sent no reply. N evertheless the
Divines have held a great eounciL and have examined
that book, and—as I heard from them at a rouse one
night, when we drank so deep that each had to pay
three grosehen for his shot, and Ι had no more money
in my fob—it will of a surety go ill with him: for in
that book he hath set down certain passages in opposi-
tion to the Holy Doctor and his disciples‚ and he saith
that the son of God is made of the Father. It con-
taineth much else, and perverteth the Theological
terms “beget ’' and “make‚'’ and others likewise; and
it payeth no heed to the arguments and questions and
sophisms of the Holy Doctor. Therefore are they re-
solved to burn that book—because they deelare they
cannot understand it, and what they do not understand,
that they burn. Q.E.D.

For every Doctor of Theology is a rabbi and a light
of the W orld.

The book moreover containeth many sayings of
Pythagoras, who was a necromaneer3 but necromancy
