1. 7] PETRUS HAFENMUSIUS

evil plant, and a corrupt tree bringeth forth corrupt
fruit, according to the EvangeL wherein the Saviour
saith, ‘⁶ A good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit.”

I well remember the monition that Doctor V alentiu
von Gatasmira, of De stloute Hostel‚ gave me when Ι
was his pupil, and desired to attend lectures on Sallust.
‘⁶ W herefore art thou fain to read Sallust, thou rebel ἓ ”
he asked. And Ι told him that Magister Jolecmn of
Breslau said that one could learn to write correct theses
out of such like poets. ’

Then said he, ‘⁶ A fiddlestickl You must needs be
well drilled in Α leoeauder's ⁴ Parts‚’ and the Epistles of
Carolus, which are taught in the Grammar School.Q-„Ia
never read*Sallustffindyet „I ‘can write„¹ theses inger-‚yse
and rose.” ⁴'

Ἠ ἕῃᾶ 'so Doctor V aleutiu brought it about that Ι
never read the Poets. And now these humanists pester
me with their new-fangled Latin, and laugh to scorn
the good old books—Aleoeunder‚ and Remigius, and
J oannes de Garum-diu, and the Cornutus, and the Com-
posita Verborum, and Master Paul Sclmeevogel his
Complete Letter-writer. They tell such thumping
elie& too, that I cross mysels when Ι hear them. Just
ξ now one of these fellows said that in some country there
is a river called the Tagus, which hath golden sands!
But Ι whistled to myself, for that could not be.

Now Ι well know you to be a poet, but Ι cannot
tell whence you learned that art. I have heard say that
when you are so minded you can turn out a screed of
verses in an hour. Butsssupuossssshaky9u1z..intellectis

to any one who hath confessed and is contrite3 and
they hold papal letters as well.

Write to me, for I arn thy humble servant. Farewell.
