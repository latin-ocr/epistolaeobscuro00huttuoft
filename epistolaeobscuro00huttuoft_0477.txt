Fairest of maidens all that in this city are,
Thy smile is like a rose, thy twinkle like a star!

She said that she would keep this as long as she
lived, for my sake. Ι pray you give me eounsel how to
eomport myself, and how to make her love me. Forgive
me for having so grossly written to your worthiness. It
is my wont to unbosom myself to my friends. Farewell,
