LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

ΙΙ J OHA Ni s ARNOLDI sendetlc many greetz‘wgs

FORASMUCH aS, and seeing that, you at all times
. would fain learn the news, according to that dict
of Aristotle: “All men by nature crave after know-
ledge''; wherefore Ι, therefore, Johamz Amoldz‘, your
disciple and humble servant, send herewith to your
mightiness, or your honour, a libel that a certain cullion
here hath clouted up to malign Herr J ohann Pfcfferlb‘ffc
of Cologne— a man beyond all doubt of properest
robity.

p I was mightily wrath, but could not hinder him so
that he should not print it, because the rascal hath here
many patronS, even nobles, who strut about the streets
like mountebanks, girt with long swords. Nevertheless
Ι averred that this thing was not seemly, because, mark
my words, these same secular poets will stir up brang-
lings without end with their metrifications, if our
Magisters do not take heed‚ and do Ποῖ straightway cite
them before the Roman Court, by the hand of Magister
Jakrob van Hoogsffraten. I fear, moreover, that there
will arise a mighty pudder among the faithful.

I entreat you, therefore, to write a book against this
scandalmonger, and put him to confusion: and another
time he will not be so foolhardy as to molest the
Magisters.

The fellow is a mere Student, neither graduated nor
qualified in Jurisprudence or Arts—but he hath kept
residence at Bologna, where there are herds of these same
secular poetS, neither enlightened in the faith nor de-
fenders thereof. A little while ago he sat at the board
and averred that the Magisters at Cologne and Paris
were persecuting Doctor Rem-lelin. Then l argued in
the contrary sense, whereupon he turned upon me with
many objurgations and railingS. 5ο that I rose from the
table and called all the company to witness how Ι was

shent——and Ι had no stomach for a morsel of victuals.
