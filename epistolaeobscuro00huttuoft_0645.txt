EVERENTIAL Salutations to your Reverence.

Venerated Herr Magister, you lately wrote to
inform me that a certain Poet in Ger-many, Erasmus
by name, of Rotterdam, inditeth many books, and that
in particular he hath drawn up a letter to the Pope in
the which he commendeth Jolzamz Reuclelin. I must
tell you that Ι have read that letter. Ι have moreover
seen another book of his, a big one, intituled “The
New Testament,” which he hath sent to the Pope,
and I understand that he would fain obtain the Pope’s
approval of it. I trust that he will not get it. For
the Master of the Sacred Palace‚ a man of consequence
and of high repute, declared that 116 could manifestly
prove Erasmus to be heretic, inasmuch as in certain
passages he reprehendeth the Holy Doctor‚ and maketh
light of the Theologians. Besides this he hath written
a treatise called “Moria Erasmi,'’ which containeth
many scandalous and irreverent passageS‚ and, here and
there, open blasphemies. VVherefore the Parisians are
desirous to burn that volume. I trow, therefore, that
the Pope will not grant his approval to the big book.
The hopes of Doctor Jalcob van Hoogstraten run high.
Yesterday he invited me to his board and told me of a
truth that a Cardinal had assured him that judgment
would go in his favour. But Jolzcmn IVz‘clc, who is
Jolmmz Rezcclzlz'n’s Proctor, withstandeth him sorely:
Doctor Jahob once said to him, in my presence, ‘⁶ You,
forsooth, are now my adversary, but, mark my words,
if I gain the day, Ι will harass you so that you will not
find a place of safety in the whole of Germany.” And
another time he said to him, “ I know that Reuclclz'n
hath no money to give you, and are you so foolhardy
