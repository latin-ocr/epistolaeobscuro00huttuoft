INTRODUCTION

gluttony and voluptuousness of monks and nuns alike‚
against the avarice of the holders of pluralities—
nay, greatly daring‚ against the pomps and vanities
of the Roman Curia itself—and Ruysbroek’s fervid
oratory found its first practical result in the establish-
ment of the stateo-lauis at Deventer, near Zutphen—
the forerunner of several similar fraternitieS. Here was
gathered together a circle of young men—laymen for
the most part— —devoting their lives to the exercise of
