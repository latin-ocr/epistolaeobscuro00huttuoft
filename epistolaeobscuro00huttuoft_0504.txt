pray that you enter not into temptation. Arise be-
times, wash your hands, comb your hair and be not
slothfu13 for the Scripture saith, “God my God,

11311131 you desire to learn from me an experience
in fascination, I must tell you that my conscience
forbiddeth. When Ι expounded to you here Om‘cl in
his “Art of Love,’' Ι warned you that no man ought
to compass the love of women by the Black Art3 and
whoso gainsayeth this is in sooth excommunicate, and
the Inquisitors of Heretical Pravity may hale him and

This former ensample, I pray you, bear in thy mind ι
Α certain Bachelor of Leipsic became enamoured of a
maiden—-Isatlze‘rine by name—the daughter of a miller,
and he tossed her a magical apple, which she caught
and placed in her bosom, between her breasts. There-
upon on a sudden she began to love that Bachelor like
a fury, so that when she was in church she could not
refrain her eyes from him, and when she should have
said, “Pater noster qui es in czelo‚'' she cried, ‘⁶ Oh,
Bachelor, where art thou 3 '⁹ Even at home, when her
father or mother called to her, she would answer, ‘⁴ Yes,
Bachelor! that is your will?’' Now the old folk
comprehended not the matter, until a certain Doctor
of Divinity, passing by the house, greeted the maiden,
saying, “(iooddell, Mistress Isatlzerine! Save you!
you have 3 fine comb!'' Thereupon Katherine made
answer, “God be praised, dear Bachelor! Wilt join
with me in 3 draught of good ale?'' And she held
out a tankard to him. Then was that divine mightily
wrath, and he made his complaint to her mother, and
said, “ Mistress M iiller, correct your daughter, for she
behaveth herself frowardly, and hath insulted our
University, in that she called 1116 ‘Bachelor,' whereas
Ι 3111 Magister Noster! Verily, verily, I say unto you
that she hath committed a deadly sin; she hath robbed
me of my good fame; and this sin is not remitted
until she hath restored that which she hath filched.
