INTRODUCTION

ancestral house of the Rothschilds still stands, a monu-
ment of “ unhappy, far-off times.'' Hebrew manu-
scripts were often among the most treasured possessions
‘of such well-to—do men. Pfefferkorn's baptism had,
perchance, not obliterated thehereditary instinct, that,
like an unerring divining-rod points to subterranean

streams feeding “The Secret River of Gold'’: why “

should not Israelites of substance keep their cherished
books, after all—for a consideration? Not only does
one of the ‘⁶ Obscure Men ’³ bluntly declare this to be
, at the root of the whole matter, but Melanchthon in
a grave discourse delivered many years later, records‚
] as an historical fact, that ‘⁴ the impostor knew very well ’
= that the Jews would forthwith seek to redeem their
books for large sumS.'' ¹

Pfefferkorn presented himself at Frankfort on the
eve of the Feast of Tabernacles—Friday, Sept. 28—
and in the presence of more than the necessary quorum
of clergy and civil officers-——but he himself being the
sole judge—confiscated all the prayer-books in the

the Jews to attend the synagogue on the coming
solemn feast-day. The clergy, however, felt that this
was going too far, and they determined to postpone
further action in the matter until the following Mon·
day. This gave the Jews a breathing—space of which
they made good use. They communicated with the
Kammergerz‘clzt at VVorms——they pointed out that
liberty, within well-ascertained bounds, had been
accorded to them in charters granted in times past
by popes and emperors—they demanded a stay of
further proceedings with a view to an appeal to Maxi-
milian himself—and, best of all, they sent an urgent

Uriel vldn Gemmingen was a man of an independent
spirit, and he could scarcely fail to be not a little piqued
at Pfefferkorn’s arrogant interference with the affairs
of his diocese. He peremptorily ordered his clergy to
take no further part in the matter3 and the Senate of
