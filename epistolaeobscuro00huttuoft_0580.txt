LETTERS OF OBSCURE ΜΕΝ

(T. MA GISTER PE TER STEINHART
to [Magister Ortwin Gratius greeting

W AS minded, Domine Ortwin, to write to you at

large concerning all manner of news—about wars
and battleS‚ and about J olzamz Reuclzlin’s affair, and now
Ι am so beflustered that I cannot sit me down for
wrath; and Ι cannot write about such things when
my heart is a-thumping me like a fist—because there
is a German here from flleissen or thereabouts, and
he promised to give me a Juristical Vocabulary‚ and
now he denieth it to me3 Ι have often exhorted him
friendly, but it is of no avail. It is manifest that he

promise createth a debt‚ I thereupon summonsed him.
Then‚ to-day he sends me an abusive letter and gibeth
at me as if I were a dotterel. And so Ι am choleric
to such a degree that Ι know not what to be at. But
Ι shall to the magistrate, and apply for a warrant of
arrest, inasmuch as that fellow is by me suspect of
absconding himself. And if he sendeth me not that
book incontinent I shall set on the catchpoles to attach
him and put him in gaol—-and then if he getteth a turn
or two of the strappado he must e'en put up with it,
for I will learn him to fail a man, and not keep his
promises. Mark my word, I will set that fellow to
rights—my life else! Because Ι must have that book,
since Ι am Setting in order my studies, and Ι have
bought books about law and other things, going every
day for four hours to the Sapienza to hear the Insti-
tutes, and the Infortiatuln, and the Canon Law too,
and the Precepts of the Chancellery. And Ι have
found here a right useful book—it exceedeth! Ι have
learnt many things from it—I doubt that you have it
in Germcmzy-—it is marvellous and mightily explicatory‚
and it is intituled “Casus longi super Institutis,'’ and
it treateth of the prettiest matters, and expoundeth the

Institutes so deeply that 4} often divideth one para-
