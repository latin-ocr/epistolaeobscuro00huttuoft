IN'FRODUCTION

giving the emancipated intellect complete freedom—
under the name of the right of private judgment—to
deal even with the seriptures and the creeds, thus
rendering a Church unnecessary.

That the Epi.s·tolae aided, directly and deliberately,
the first three of these movements must be obvious to
their readers: that they indireetly furthered the sub-
versive aims of Luther‚ as well as those of his successors
and rivals‚ is also indisputable—but that their authors
took this line of malice aforethought is more than
doubtful.

Such considerations show us why it is so hard to
assign to the Epistola& with confidence‚ their true place
and function in the German Renaissance. It is because
in Germany the triumph of the revival of learning in
winning intellectual freedom was, all too soon, ob-
scured, if not neutralised‚ by one of its own indirect
results, Protestantism, as we now see, was merely a
by-product of a vast fermentation; but the effects pro-
duced by the reformers in their chaotic endeavours,
not only to modify the tenets and purify the abuses
of an ancient Church‚ but to dispense with it altogether,
no man fores a.w 'lhat Chuich had become—as is the
fate of Churches——inextricably entangled in political
affairs, and the effects of the shattering blows it received
are felt in a thousand forms, whether for good or ill, to
the present day.

We need not wonder that our Satire is lost to view
during forty years of blind and bitter strife. Wit and
humour are swept out of sight,

‘⁵ 'Mid clouds enveloped of polemio dust,
Which showers of blood seem rather to incite
'l'han to allay. Anathemas are hurled
From both sides; veteran thunders (the brute test
Of truth) are met by fulminations new—
Tartarcan flags are caught at, and unfurled—
Friends strike at friends—the flying shall pul-sue—
And Victor-y sickens, ignorant where to rest Ῐ ”

But let us not confuse with mere hoarse and inco-
herent battle-eries a work of literary art which belongS‚
after all, to the fair morn, and not to the day of gloom
and agony that it ushered in. Rather let us be content
