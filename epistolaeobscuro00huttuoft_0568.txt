LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

syllogism in Baroco or Celarent, for he is no logician.
Not long ago he called me an ass, and Ι said, ‘⁶ Come
now, if thou art so bold, dispute with me! ” for I made
free to “ thou ” him. But he was silent. Then pressing
my attaek, I said ‘⁶ I will prove that thou art an 333.
Thus: whatever bears a burden is an ass—thou bearest
3 burden—therefore thou art an 333. The minor premiss
is evident‚ since thou bearest that book.” Now this
was true, for he was carrying 3 book, that Jalmb von
chestenbeog had given him to read, against Doetor
Jalfob vem H oogstraten ,· and he was not shrewd enough
to deny my major, although Ι could not have proved
that—but I knew full well that he was unversed in
logie. Then quoth Ι, “ Herr Doctor, you wish to
thrust your nose in Theologians’ affairs, which pertain
not to your Faculty3 I counsel you to hold aloof,
seeing that you have no knowledge of the matter ; 6136
you will surely come to grief, for the Theologians are
not minded that J urists should meddle with questions
of Faith.” Forthwith, fuming he eried‚ ‘⁶ Ι not only
understand these things, but Ι ean see that thou art a
damned beast l ” Then Ι was enraged, and started up,
and that day the strife was hot between us! But
Doctor Peter Illegser, parish priest of Frankfort, said
to me, “ Come now, let us go to the inn, and seek some
victuals, for it is dinner-time; and let this worthy
gentleman be, for he doth not yet know his rudiments;
he must go to school and learn.”

But, mark you, Magister Orth‘n, we will roundly
avenge that insult; the fellow is a student of Cologne,
and I know for certain that he resided at De Monte
hostel; if therefore you will prevail on the University
to cite him, we will eonviet him of perjury3 for when
he matriculated he made oath that he would work for
the good of the University, whereas now he sideth with
Johmm Reuclzlin, against it. Prithee, do this forth-
with—and send me that treatise of Jolmmz Pfqffer-
korn’s entitled, ‘⁶ The Defence of J. P. against slanders.”
A student lately brought it hither, and my heart aeheth
to possess the book, for it containeth many subtle pro-
positionS. The Lord grant you welfare and peace.

Amen.
