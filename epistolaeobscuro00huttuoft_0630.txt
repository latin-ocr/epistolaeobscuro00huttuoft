LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Theology is now in blossom, and that there is a cloud
of learned Divines in all parts of Germangs. Moreover
all men, masters or servants, nobles or churls, do them
high honour, calling them Magisternosters by reason of
their pre-eminence, and doffing their hats and caps when
they meet one, saying, “Commend me to your egre-
giousness, eximious Herr Magisternoster 1 ’⁹ And
when a Magisternoster passeth along the street all
folk salute him as though a prince passed by. And
this is well—for Magisternosters are as the Apostles
of God. So then in your letter you tell me great
things N evertheless must I hold myself opposed, and
say that this doubtless is true enough for Cologne,
but not elsewhere. Here, especially, in my own
country, Magisternosters who are Regulars are paid
no honours, but the Canons and nobles shamefully
belittle them. Yet the secular priests are accorded
honour, and held in respect. Now this seemeth to
me unbecoming‚ for Regulars should ever take the
first place, inasmuch as they are the more spiritual,
and a Regular with respect to celestiality standeth
above a Secular. For Regulars are naturally fitted
for chanting lauds to the glory of God, and of his
Holy Mother, the ever-blessed Virgin Mary, and of
all the Saints and Martyrs‚ and Confessors, and the
rest. Therefore it seemeth to me a great error for
men to honour Seculars rather than Regulars. More-
over the secular Theologians in high places begin to
wax proud, and are, as it were, opposed to the Regulars,
while they themselves grow more worldly, and further
removed from the Kingdom of Heaven. You know
how that Christ hath said, “Ye who follow me shall
sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’'
Now Regulars have left their goods and chatteIS, and
are despised in this world, therefore are they nighest
to the Kingdom of Heaven. Forgive me in that I
write such things concerning secular Theologians, seeing
that you are one. But it is otherwise at Cologne, for
there foll< are humble and reverent towards Regulars.
Nay, even you may be yourself deemed a Regular,
as far as zeal goeth, and you once said to me at
Cologne, “Herr Otto, I trow that one day I shall
