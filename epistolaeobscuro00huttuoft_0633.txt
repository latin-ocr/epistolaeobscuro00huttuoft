11. 44] PETER OF WORMS

and it seemeth to me that he favoureth Jolzann
Rezcclelin; but Ι cannot tell. You will pereeive there-
fore how matters stand. I allow that the Theologians
in Cologne are held in high reverenee, and that the
Secular Theologians and lay folk are in close bonds
with the Regulars—-but here it is not SO. Yet Ι trust
that when Reuclelin is overthrown, then the Theologians
will rejoiee in their turn; which may our only-begotten
Saviour grant. Amen.

has been printed here.

I trow, indeed, seeing that you are a Poet, you will
learn from it for the perfeeting of your art.

Notary, who was doubtless proficient in that mystery,

author, one Isomer, is the father of all the Poets.

He told me moreover, that there is another Homer,
in Greek.

‘⁴ Nay,'’ quoth Ι, “ what care Ι about Greek? The
Latin one is better, for I want it to send to Germangs,
to Magister Ortwin, who pays no heed to those Greek
fantasticalitieS.”

Then I sounded him concerning the theme of this
book. And he told me that it treated of certain folk
called Greeks, who made war on some other foll< called
Trojans, whom I had heard tell of before. These same
T rojans had a great city, and the Greeks pitched before
it and lay there for more than ten years. And anon
