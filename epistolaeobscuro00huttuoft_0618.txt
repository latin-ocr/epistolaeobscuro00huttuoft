LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

grammarians, when you may find all things concerning
feet, and the quantities of syllableS, set forth metrically
in the third part of Α leoeander, not to speak of the
Art of Scansion and the rest. Moreover that same
Diomedes was no good Christian, for I once read that
he kept horses that fed upon men, and he himself gave
them men to eat.’'

Then the Curialist laughed loudly, jeering me,
and asked me what I made the first syllable of
‘⁶ Abacuck ἲ ”

Ι replied‚ “ We must distinguish. For, in so far as
it is a proper name, the first syllable is indifferent,
according to Aleoecmder :—

‘ Ad placitum poni propriorum multa notavi ; ’

but in so far as it is asked what quantity the first hath
conformably to the quiddity of common nouns, then it
hath the first short; according to Α leoennder, who saith
that in first syllables α before h is short—exceptions
exce ted.''

'then he laughed me to scorn yet again, and said,
“ Get thee gone, thou Cologne abecedarian, with thine
Alexander, who was but a Parisian ass—and there are
plenty more.'’ And thus, shamefully reviling the good
Alexander, he went his way. “Hal'’ quoth Ι, “to-
morrow you shall see!” And in the morning I drew
forth a poem that I had concocted in the night—time in
praise of Alexander, and I send you a copy thereof. So
soon as my lord set eyes on that poem, he applauded
me, and cried,

“ Oh Wllaelm, can you compose such verses as
these? And I never knew it! In future I shall love
you more than ever1’⁷ Therefore Ι trust Ι shall get
good preferment, and when it pleases Heaven that I
achieve somewhat, then shall I betake myself, as a
priest, to mine own country once more.
