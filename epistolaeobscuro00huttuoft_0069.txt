INTRODUCTION

God or man, impelled by wicked, damnable‚ and reck-
less loquacity‚ have published a certain scandalous libel
entitled ‘Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum (etc.),’ and
have dared to send it to the ends of the earth, the better
to disseminate their wicked calumnieS.” The faithful
are thereupon admonished to give up any copies they
may posseSS, in order that they may be burned: the
authorS‚ whoever they may be, are declared excom·
municate; and the clergy are ordered to denounce the
scandalous and heretical work from their pulpits—even
in the vulgar tongue‚ if necessary. In this the advisers
of his Holiness did not show their usual perspicacity.
In the absence of newspapers there was no better
advertising medium than the pulpit. Accordingly a
few months later a second edition of the New Series
appeared, containing an Appendix of eight more
letters, some of which are as malicious and brilliantly
scurrilous as any that had gone before.

The Reuchlin trial, though prologue to a drama
of entrancing interest, came to a lame and impotent
conclusion. The court—with the sole exception of
Sylvester PrieriaS, Master of the Sacred Palace, and
a Dominican—decided in Reuchlin’s favour, but Leo,
in the interests of peace, would not promulgate the
sentence. On the contrary, he issued the mandate
known as ‘⁶ De Supersedendo‚” and this meant that the
whole matter was to be laid indefinitely on the shelf.
In 1520, however, events took an unexpected turn.
The pope promulgated the sentence, and, ignoring the
judgment of the majority of the court, he sided with
the minority of one, declared the Augenspiegel a
dangerous book, and saddled Reuchlin with the costs
of the trial. ,

The scholar was bent but not broken by the blow.
Impoverished by the tedious lstigation, he bravely
struggled on, earning sufficient for his small necessities
by teaching and lecturing during the five years that
were left to him of a blameless and honourable life.

By his friends, and they were neither few nor
powerless, he was upheld to the last as a champion
of the New Learning and a martyr in its cause—the
real victor, too, in the fight.
