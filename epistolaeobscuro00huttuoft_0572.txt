LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Tlaeobald Fettielc by name, who is now Doctor of Medi-
cine, and him Ι recognised‚ for he formerly resided at
Cologne at De Monte Hostel ; and. he talked more than
all the rest together. Then said Ι to him, ‘⁶ Y ou ought
to bear in mind the oath that you took to the Rector
and University of Colog7ze.'’

‘⁶ To the jakes with the pack of you‚” quoth he. But
let this pass.

Afterwards‚ when we had taken our departure from
lVorms, certain fearful men on horseback met us, with
cross-bows in their hands, and made as though they
