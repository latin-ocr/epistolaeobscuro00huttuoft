LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

the fables of the Poet‚ and of these you may judge
from the instances subjoined:

Of the Python that Apollo slew, the Psalmist saith,
“ This dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.’⁷
And, again, “Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the
basilisk.”

Concerning Suturu—who is always feigned an old
man, and the father of the gods—devouring his own
children, Ezelsiel saith: “The fathers shall eat the
sons in the midst of thee.”

Diana signifieth the Blessed Virgiu fflury, going
hither and thither with a virgin company. And there-
fore it is written in the Psulms, “The virgins that be
her fellows'’; and, elsewhere, ‘⁶ Draw me, we will run
after thee in the savour of thine ointments.’'

Concerning Jupiter, who after the defloration of
Callisto returned to heaven, it is written, Matt. oeiz‘„ “ I
will return to my house from whence I came out.”

Of the lapidification of the maiden Aglauros, whom
Mercury turned into a stone, J ob hinteth, ‘⁶ W hose heart
is as firm as a stone.”

Also‚ it is related in Holy Writ how Jupiter had
commerce with the virgin Europa, though formerly I
knew it not, for he spake to her thus, “Hearken, O
daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear, because
the King hath pleasure in thy beauty.”

Cadmus, too, seeking for his sister, is a figure of
Christ who seeketh for his sister, to wit, the soul of
man; and he buildeth a city, that is, the Church.

Concerning Actaeon, who beheld Diana naked,
Ezelciel prophesied‚ saying, “Thou wast bare and full
of confusion, and I passed by thee and saw thee.''

Not without cause is it written in the Poets that
Bacchus· was twice born, for by him is denoted Christ,
who was twice born, once before the worlds, and a
second time humanly and carnally.

Semele also, who nursed Bacchus, is an image of the
Blessed Viigin, of whom it is written in Emodus,
‘⁶ Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will
give thee thy wageS.''

Furthermore the story of Pyramus and Thisbe is
to be allegorically and spiritually expounded thus:
