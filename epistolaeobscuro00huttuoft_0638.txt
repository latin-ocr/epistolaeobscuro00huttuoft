LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

this hurt. Even when Students are sent by their
parents to hostels and colleges they will not stay
there, but are off to the Poets to learn stuff and
nonsense. He told me that at Leipsz‘e he used to
have two score pupils, and when he went to the
Church, or to the market, or to stroll in the Rosen-
garten, they would all follow after him. In those
days it was a grave offence to study poetry. If a
penitent admitted in the confessional that he had
privily listened to a Bachelor lecturing upon V irgiL
the priest would impose upon him a thumping pen-
ance—to wit, to fast every Friday‚ 01· to rehearse
daily the seven penitential Psalms. He swore to
me, on his conscience, that he saw a candidate re-
jected because he had once been detected by one
of the Examiners reading Terence on a feast-day.
Would that it were thus in the Universities now;
then I should not have to drudge here at the Curia.
For what work is there for us at the Universities?
We cannot make a living. Students no longer will
dwell in Hostels under Magisters. Among twenty
Students you will scarce find one with a mind to
graduate. Yet all of them are eager to study the
Humanities. When a Magister lectureth he findeth
no audience; but, as for the Poets, when they dis-
course it is a marvel to behold the crowd of listeners.
And thus the Universities throughout all Germany
are minished and brought low. Let us pray God,
then, that all the Poets may perish, for “it is ex-
pedient that one man should die—’' that is that the
Poets‚ of whom there are but a handful in any one
University‚ should perish, rather than so many Uni-
versities should come to naught.

And now you will surely send me a letter—or long
will be my lamentations over your neglect. Farewell.

From Roma.
