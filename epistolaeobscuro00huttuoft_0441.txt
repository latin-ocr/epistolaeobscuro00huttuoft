Devil's 11111116.

Then quoth Ι, ·· ‘x‘vhat care I tho' you are my enemy ἲ
Ι have had 6116111163 10 1116 full 113 611131 33 you, and yet I’ve
worsted them. And what tho⁷ you 316 11 Ρο61 ’ἕ Ι have
Poets who 1116 friends ofinine. and they are just 113 good
113 you. To the jakes with your poetry! What do you
take 1116 for 2²- Thinkest thou I'm 11 gowk, or that Ι grew
011 11 1166, like 1111 apple ἵ

Doetor Rem'lelirz, and whether you 31111 take up the
cudgels on 1113 behalf, and send me 301116 news. Fare—
