LETTERS OF OBSCURE ΜΕΝ

that Philipp Melanehthon, and Jakol) Winfflloeling and
Beatus Rhenanus, and er'colccs Gerhefflus, were all of
the plot. He averred, moreover, that they write letters
'co Ulrich Hzotten, who studieth at Bologna, seeking
that he should join them. Besides these he had heard
of none. Then Ι enquired in other quarters whether
Erasmus of Rotterclam taketh their part? And a
certain merchant answered, saying, “ Erasmus taketh
his own part; but, be assured he will never be the
friend of those Theologians and Friars3 and he hath
evidently, in his words and writings, defended and
vindicated Jolaann Benclelz'n and hath addressed letters
to the Pope on his behalf.⁷’ ·

From others Ι learnt that Paul Rivius is also of the
number. Some say 'that Jolemm §Peisaleammer and
Kom-ad1³eutinger—xvho are in high favour with the
Emperor—also consort with this crew, and do all in
’cheir power against the Theologians of Cologne, and
in honour of Johamz, Reuelelin. A certain student of
Eofm‘t, a friend of mine, tells me that Isonrad Dlzctianzcs
is the bitterest of all, and that Theologians are so hate·
ful ’co him that he cannot endure to hear those of
Cologne as much as named3 he saith, too, that he hath
seen full twenty letters of his, in which he urgeth
certain students to join the Reuchlinists.

This is all the information Ι have guthered so far3
when Ι learn more, Ι will impart it to you. Farewell
in Christ.

IR, I would have your magnificence to know, that
S when I received your letter Ι was affrigh'ced beyond
