LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

And therefore, Heri· Ortzcin, Ι beg that you will
look upon me graciously, for I am an astonishing ally
of yours and love you incredibly. Commend me also, I
pray you, to Jolesann Ifffqffi’rlsorm once a Jew, but now
happily baptized in Christ. His treatise entitled ‘⁶ The
Defence of Johann Pfefferkorn against Calumnies'’
hath been brought to me from Germanys, and Ι have
read it through and have jotted down ‘notabilia and
summaries in the margin. Ι think very highly of the
said book. But you must tell ΙῗῘξῙβὶἼἸιυνη that one of
the officers of the Curia is a mighty upholder of ‘soleam
Reachslin. He lias collected sundry paragraphs out of
Rfi’fferlcorn's book, and seeks to prove that in these
passages both Heresy and the crime of High Treason
are to be found; and he declares that he wishes pro-
ceedings might be taken against Jolmm( ΙῗῙζῩβὲνᾸ-ονη 011
the grounds of Heresy and High Treason. I send you
herewith a schedule in which these passages are copied
out, and subjoined are the refutations which Ι have
composed—for Ι held a disputation with that officer,
and defended Johann Jisss'ffi’s'st'fflll to the utinost of my
ability. And so, farewell, and look upon me as an
acquaintance as well as a friend.

Following are the passages alleged by the Reuch-

been, and never will be true.
