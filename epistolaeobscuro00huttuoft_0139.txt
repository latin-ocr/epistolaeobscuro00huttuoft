CORNELIUS FENESTRIFICIS

super sententias essent fantasiae3 similiter processu8‚
copulata, reparationes omnium bursarum dixerunt quod
essent vanitates. Tunc fui ita iratus quod non scivi
respondere.
passagium ad Treverim ad videndum tunicam domini,
quia dixerunt quod fortassis non esset tunica domini.
Et probaverunt sic per Cornutum syHogismum: “Quic-
quid est laceratum, non debet ostendi pro tunica domini:
sed illa est talis: ergo etc.'' q

Tunc ego concessi maiorem, sed negavi minorem.
Tunc probaverunt sic: “Beatus Hieronymus dicit:
‘ Vetusto oriens collisus errore tunicam domini incon-
sutilem desuper contextam per totum minutatim dis-
cerpsit per frusta.'” Et ego respondi, quod sanctus
Hieronymus non est de stilo evangelii, nec immodicite
ex apostolis3 et sic surrexi de mensa et reliqui illos
trufatores.

⁴²⁷ processus: methodological treat-

occasion nearly 2,000,000 pilgrims
ises compiled for the use of students

availed themselves of the opportunity

Cum hoc etiam vexaverunt me, quod feci -3

at the various hostels, according to
the views they severally affected.

⁴²³ copulata: compilations from the
writings of various authors upon a
single subject. Novices, who had
to study these, were hence called
“copulatistae.” See ii. 35.

²⁸ reparationes: the same as “ Sum-
mae.'' Panzer, i. p. 308 (228).

⁵¹ Treverim. The venei-able relic
known as the Holy Coat of Treves is
preserved in the Cathedral. Accord-
ing to tradition it was deposited
there by St. Helena (claimed by the
Germans as a native of a village—
Euren-near Treves), about AJ). 327.
Trithemius, writing in 1512 (the date
of the first recorded ‘⁶ exposition '' of
the relic), states that he had heard
as a boy that the coat was deposited
for safety under the High Altar by
Pope John in 1196. But the relic
has had many wanderings. In 1640
it was removed for safety to Cologne,
in 1667 to Ehrenbreitstein, and in
1759 back to Treves. W’e next hear
of it successively at Ehrenbreitstein
once more, qurzburg, Bamberg,
and Augsburg. In 1810, however, it
was restored to Treves by Napoleon's
orders. It was exhibited in 1844,
and again in 1891, 011 which last

of seeing it.

⁵³ Corn. sylb: a cornute, or cera-
tine, argument is a dilemma. The
classical instance is that quoted in
Diogenes Laertius, vii. 187 ; “that
you have not cast away, you have3
you have not cast your horus—there-
fore you have horns.”

⁵⁷ Hieron. .· St. Jerome’s metaphor,
humorously treated as literal by the
“duo trufatores,’' is to be found in
the ΕΜ). ad Damasum, xv. ε “Quoniam
vetusto Oriens inter se populorum
furore collisus, indiscissam domini
tunicam, et desuper textam, minut-
atim per frusta discerpit.’'

⁵⁸ inconsutilem. This adjective is
never used except in this connec-
tion. 'l‘rithemius relates that within
the chest containing the relic was
found the inscription: “Haec est
inconsutilis sacra Domini et Salva-
toris nostri Jesu Christi (tunica).’'
And in the Breviary of Treves there
is a hymn beginning :—

“ O vestis inconsutilis,
Pro dulei nato Virginis—”
See A Pilyrimaye to the Holy Coat

of Treres, by R. F. Clarke, S.J.,
London, 1892.
