made any converts, the fact has not been recorded.
Perhaps F rau Reuchlin had a word to say upon the
project, or the invitation met with no response. At
any rate we hear no more of the matter, and Reuchlin’s
first Jewish visitor of whom we have any certain in-
formation was none other than that ‘⁶ most scelerate
Christian,’⁷ J ohann Pfefferkorn himself—eager to flesh
his new-girt weapon upon the hapless rabbis of Frank-
fort. Some historians, notably Graetz, have seen a
subtle design in this visit—a device to entrap Reuehhn,
and exhibit him in the ranks of the bigots. The sug-
gestion seems unfounded. Reuchlin was known as a
Hebraist; he was the legal representative of the Domi—
nican body in Germany, and he had publicly signified
his desire to make Christian proselytes. What more
natural, in the circumstances, than that he should be

One thing is clear——Pfefferkorn gained little by his
interview. Reuchlin's scholarly instincts rose in revolt
against the suggestion that he should become an acces-
sory in the murder of a venerable literature : moreover,
he was not favourably impressed by the renegade him-
self, whose literary qualifications he evidently doubted.

Reuchlin, indeed, has recorded that in his library he
quietly tested Pfefferkorn by directing his attention to
a Talmudical work, whereupon his visitor shuffled, and
explained that he had only studied the Bible. The
learned jurist naturally found no difficulty in putting
his finger upon the apparent informality in the im—
perial mandate, and politely sent his visitor empty

{fter the cold douche administered by Archbishop
Uriel, the attack upon Hebrew literature for the mo-
ment slackened, and the Jews took the opportunity of
formally laying their views before the emperor through
their representatives Jonathan Levi Zion of Frankfort
and Isaac Triest of Ratisbon. The Margrave of Baden‚ .
too, ventured to point out to the emperor that his
Jewish subjects were protected by unimpeachable char—

and all seemed going well, until Pfefferkorn once more
appeared upon the scene, not without a commendatory
