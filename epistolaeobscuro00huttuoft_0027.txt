IT is a characteristic of great Satire that its savour can
seldom be appreciated, and its true inwardness grasped
without due study of the context—the context being the
history of the period to which it belongs. The satirist
may incidentally so lash the vices and follies of the natural
man that readers in every age wince as though the whip

an account of the genesis of the Letters into a coherent
narrative, we must accordingly take up a thread here,
