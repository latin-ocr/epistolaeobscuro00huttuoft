INTRODUCTION

wald some wealthy townsfolk, Lotz by name, seem in
111016 3611363 than one to have taken the stranger 111.
Old Lotz was a shrewd man of business, and he evi-
dently thought that Hutten pere would repay with
interest any advances made to his son. Perhaps the
old knight disabused him somewhat brusquely of this
idea *at any rate, in a season of bitter frost, Ulrich
fied from Greifswald, was pursued by Lotz’s servants,
stripped not only of his wallet and his few books, but
even of his clothes, and by a miracle reached Rostock‚
more dead than alive. U npleasant though this adven-
ture was, it might not have been worth recording had
it not led to 1116 publication of Hutten’s first important
work. This work, the Qaerelen, consists of twenty
elaborate elegies‚ describing his scurvy treatment by
the Limes, and calling down the vengeance of God
and man upon his persecutors, Two of the 6168163 are
dedicated to Crotus Rubianus and Eoban Hesse respec-
tively, and it is noteworthy that the author seems to
recognise the bonds of sympathy that were beginning
to be established between the young adherents of the
New Leaining, by imploring the aid of 1111 German
humanists against an attack made upon one of 111611
numbei. And 110117 1176 pass over 111 a few 111163

Having become to some extent reconciled to his
father, through the instrumentality of Crotus, Ulrich,
in the spring of the following year betook himself to
Italy, ostensibly with the intention of studying law.
