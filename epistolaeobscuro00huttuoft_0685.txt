11. 65] BARTHEL KUTZ

to the legitimate as to bastards‚ who are peculiarly
fitted for him. And if only you were a monk you
would possess every qualification for this art, and you
would be an egregious instrument of the devil—-but Ι
know not whether you are a monk. If such you be,
then Ι should be right glad. Monks above all men
have this gift—that they are very obstinate, and what-
ever they take in hand that they carry through—as Ι
lately heard from one Paul Lang who has written
a most excellent treatise, with verses, against Jacob
W'z'mplteling and has flouted him finely. They say of
that same Paul—saving your reverence—that he has
run out of the cloister in nine diverse ways.

And what none else attempteth to do, he doeth. 1
believe too that he is crazy at times, and is base-born.
The third condition abideth in him. Ι rejoice greatly
that he also resembleth you who have dealings with
the devil-but, let this pass, with all respect. I have
here a notable necromantic formula that I would gladly
communicate to you openly—but Ι am afraid lest when
you are crazy your servant may find this letter and read
it, and then the devil would fetch both him and me.
Therefore Ι will proceed according to my wont, for
when Ι deal with secret matters I write upon paper
without ink, and then none save a bastard can read it,
and this I have determined to do in the present case.
The formula runneth thus :—

l

You, I know, will understand this, and it is the very
truth, but Ι warn you, and conjure you by the virtue
of all the forbidden Sciences not to impart it to a single
soul. And now farewell; from Rupreclztsau: in a
little while you may expect somewhat more, and
weightier, from me if you relish these presents.
