was otherwise in the world of Letters. The Revival
of Learning was from its very nature a transient
phenomenon. The awakening glory of sunrise affects
the imagination more forcibly than noontide's steadier
ς glow, and scholars in Italy were already turning their
Ξ attention from the revival of an old literature to the
. creation of a new. Moreover‚ the growing possibilities
Α of the vernacular were beginning once more to be borne
, in upon writers of genius, and the ltalian of Machiavelli
and Ariosto was destined soon to eclipse the Latinity

Even through the night of the Dark Ages a
“phantom of false morning ⁷² had gleamed from time
to time, and Humanism--in fact, if not in name—had
found its way across the Alps long before the close of
the fifteenth century. Greek scholars and teachers‚
who had for many years found an appreciative and

in increasing numbers when the walls of Constantinople
fell before ‘the Moslems' cannon, and not a few of their
pupils were to be met with seattered sporadically over
western Europe. To instance Germany alone-—
Johann W essel (1420—89), known as [Δια] Mundi
and Ilsagister Contradictz'onum, had studied in both
Greece and Italy, and was acquainted with Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew——teaching these languages privately

Johann M'uller, of -Konigsberg (1436-‘7 6), better known
as Regiomontanus, spent seven or eight years in Italy
studying Greek: Rudolph Agricola <1443-85> learnt
Greek under T heodore Gaza at F errara, and afterwards
lectured on the classics at Heidelberg.

But the voices of men such as these, crying in the
