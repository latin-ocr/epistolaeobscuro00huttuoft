INTRODUCTION

who had caused her father much grief by her clan-
destine marriage with his foe, Duke Albert of Munich‚
lost her husband in 1508; and the disconsolate widow
forthwith retired from a distasteful world—entering
the Franciscan Convent of Santa Clara at Munich.
Of this she became abbess, and mortified her fiesh
with fastings and scourgings. To this noble lady
Pfefferkorn had secured an introduction.

No record exists of what must have been an inte-
resting interview between the quondam butcher and the
widowed princess: we can but form inferences from its
results. The renegade was undoubtedly armed with
commendatory letters from the Dominicans, and we
may assume that his zeal, whether real or affected,
soon fanned the glow of piety within the royal abbess’s
breast into a flame of fanaticism. At any rate a letter
to her brother was soon forthcoming from Kunigunde:
its purport was quite simple--the Jews ought to be
gagged and robbed, and Pfefferkorn was the man to
do it.

On August 19, 1509, Maximilian--the natural liber-

municipal councillorS‚ all Hebrew books that called in
question Christian tenets, or upheld Judaism. The
net was a wide one. An ancient literature, in short,
was to be swept away at the will of the ignorant agent
of pedantic bigots who could not read a line of it.

Pfefferkorn's next move was a bold one, though,
as the event proved, it was injudiciouS. He selected
Frankfort-on-Main as the scene of his first operations.
In that flourishing city there were then many students
of Talmudic literature, and to gather thence a rich
harvest sor the flames would inspire everywhere a
wholesome respect for the imperial mandate. It is
possible that there was another motive that could not
well be avouched. Many Jews of considerable wealth
then dwelt in the Juden-gasse of ankfort, where the
