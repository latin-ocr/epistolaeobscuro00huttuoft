LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

whereat I marvelled. I trow he lieth sleepless sor
many nights when he thinketh out these high and
subtle matters. Howbeit there are many who say that
he preacheth flapdoodle—and they call him Quadru-
laz‘or, and Jolmny Jolthead, and Gom-emp, for the
reason that once he was found wanting in disputation,
and he was sent packing with greater ignominy than
had befallen a man for a hundred years: and a fellow
waited for him near the chair, and doffed his cap—not
by way of honour, but as those Jews did when they
crowned Christ—and he bent the knee before him, and
said, “Herr Doctor, by your favour, may God bless
your bath!'' Then quoth he, “Deo Gratias, Herr
Bachelor,” but he said 110 more, and went away—and I
heard that the tears stood in his eyes, and that it was
believed that he afterwards wept. And when Ι heard
of these insults my bowels of compassion were moved,
and had I but known who that rascal was, Ι would
have fallen upon him tho’ Ι had lost my head with a deal
plank. He hath one pupil who is, believe me, a learned
man—more than learned, as it were ; more learned than
his teacher, perchance, albeit he is but a Bible Bachelor;
he has already, a little while—a very little while—ago,
put forward fully twenty questions and arguments, all
against the realists; for instance, “VVhether God is
predicamental’'; “XVhether essence and existence are
distinct”; “whether Rollations are fundamentally
distinct‚” and “VVhether the ten predicaments are
actually distinct.’'

Mercy on us! what a crowd of respondents! I
never in my life saw more disputants in a lecture-
room; yet he honourably defended his theses. A
magister hath but to contend with one opponent. Ι
wonder that the Dean admitted them—I believe he
was mad by reason of the dog-days, for it is contrary to
the statutes.

And when the disputation was over I straightway
metrified these verses in his honour :——-

Liveth here a learned scholar,
Who debated, twice or thrice,
If the Being of Essentia
Can be, by distinctions nice,
