INTRODUCTION

the question being submitted to them, the doctors
of the Sorbonne were quite in their clement, and they
lost no time in issuing their condemnation, which
appeared on December 5, 1514, under the title of
Acta Doctorum Parrltz'sz'ensz'um de sacratissima facultate
theologica . . . contra Speculum oculare Ioannis reue-Min
(eta).

This thunderbolt proved innocuous; the death of
Louis XII. three weeks later doubtless prevented its
being followed up as had been intended. It should be
mentioned that there appeared, almost simultaneously,
another dull but vituperative pamphlet, in Pfefferkorn's
name, entitled Sturm Gloclc (The Tocsin). For pub-
lishing this book and the Acta, QuentelL the printer‚ had
legal proceedings instituted against him on the ground
that he had acted in defiance of the emperor’s edict, and
Pfefferkorn was coupled with him as defendant.1

Meanwhile at Rome little progress was made with
the great suit, the most notable fact in connection with
it being the translation of the Augesnspz'egel into Latin
by Martinus Groning‚ by order of the court, and the
consequent discovery of the fact that the translation
hitherto relied upon, that, namely‚ provided by Hoog-
straten, was grossly inaccurate. This put the whole
case in a fresh light, and the arguments on both sides
had to be begun anew. But while interest in the case
itself slackened‚ the conflict it typified grew fiercer.
By this time what had been at the outset a personal
squabble had become a widespread campaign from
which no scholar in Germany, however peace-loving‚
could altogether hold aloof. One after another joined
the forces on either side.

And so, with ever-growing fury, the bitter fray
went on. Neither party could claim the victory-—
peace with honour was impossible. It seemed as
though every weapon of controversial hatred had been
used in vain—from the ponderous artillery of pedantry
to the poisoned dagger of slander.
