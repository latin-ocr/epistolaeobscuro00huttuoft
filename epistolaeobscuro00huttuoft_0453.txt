Now, prithee‚ give me counsel in the matter afore-
said, for you are even, in some sort, a jurist. „kz
Ι have made up some verses, and Ι send thern to ” ‘·
you herewith. Α Clzorz‘ambz‘-lzeoeczmetrz'-sapplzz‘ambz'c- o ι

“ He who a perfect Catholic would be,
Must aye with the Pal-isians agree—
Because
Of every other
Their University is mothel-3
Cologne the sacred, rauks as second,
And bulwark of the Faith is reckoned—
To this
If any man say ‘ Nay,'
He the penalty must pay ;
Doetor Rene-Idm, to wit,
Augen-spiegel who writ 3
Whom A rnold of Tongern, magisternoster‚
Unmasked as an heretieal impostor—-
As did Master Hoogstraten, not least though the last,
Who into the fire T lze Eyeglass did cast ! '’

Had I but materiaIS, Ι would compose a tome against
that windbag‚ and prove that he is de ficeto excom-
munieate.

Ι have no further leisure for writing‚ for I must
needs hie to lecture, where a Magister handleth pro et
con very subtle opinions on ancient philosophy, and I
listen—to finish my course.

Fare ye well, above all my comrades and friends
here and everywhere and in all places of honest report.

(L CORNELIUS FENSTERMA CHER to
Allagister Ortwin Gratius, many gweetings

GREETINGS as many as are the stars of heaven and
the sands of the sea. Reverend Herr Magister,
I eneounter here much strife and brangling with certain
lewd fellows who boast that they are lettered‚ and yet

have read not Logie‚ the Seience of Scienees.
