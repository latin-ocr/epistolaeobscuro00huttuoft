sarial; it was deemed a great scandal that a student
should walk in the street without having Peter of
Spain or the Parva Logia-alia under his arm; or, if
they were grammarianS, then they would carry with
them Alexander’s Doctrinale, or his Opus Minus, or
the Vade Elec-um„ or the Exerez‘tz'um Puerorum, or
Johann Sinthen’s Dicta. Then were there zealous
students in the Schools, who held the Masters of
Arts in honour, and if they spied a Magister they
fell to trembling as if they had seen a devil. He
told me that in those days there were four promo-
tions of bachelors each year, and many a time fifty
or sixty graduated at once. In those days the Uni-
versity was in full bloom3 and when a student had
resided for a year and a half he was made Baehelor,
and after three years, or two and a half years, in
all, a Magister. Thus it came to pass that his parents
were well pleased, and freely sent him money when
they saw that their son had attained a place of honour.
But now-a-days all the students must needs attend
lectures on Vah-gil and Pliny and the rest of the new-
fangled authors—what is more, they may listen to
them for five years and yet get no degree: and so,
when they return home, their parents ask them, saying,
“What art thou?” And they reply that they are
naught‚ but that they have been reading Poetry!
And then the parents are perplexed——but they see
that their sons are not grammarians, and therefore
they are disgruntled at the University, and begrudge
sorely the money they have spent. Then they say
to others, ‘⁴ Send not your sons to the University—
they’ll learn naught‚ but go trapesing in the streets
anights; money given for such a bringing-up is but
thrown away.”

The old Magister further-more told me that in his
time there were full two thousand students at Lez'psz'c,
and a like number at Erfhcrt ‚· four thousand at Vienna
and as many at Cologoze-and so with the rest. Now-
a-days there are not as many students at all the Uni-
versities put together as there were then in one or
two. The Magisters at Leipsic bitterly lament the
scarcity of scholars. It is the Poets that do them
