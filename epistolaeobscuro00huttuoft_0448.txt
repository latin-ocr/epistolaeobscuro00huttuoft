REETING, of ponderosity to make a thousand l

Reverend Herr Magister, you must know that there
is a mighty buzz here concerning you, and the theo-
logers applaud you hugely because you pay no heed to
any man, and have written in defence of the faith
against Doctor Reaclzliu.

Howbeit certain doltish fellows here—and those

jurists too who are not enlightened in the Christian

saith—scoff at you and say all manner of things against
you; but they are of small account, for the Faculty
of Theology upholdeth you. And lately, when those
books found their way here which are intituled ‘⁶ Acta
Parezeie-rzsessumj' straightway almost all the Magisters
bought them and were mightily pleased. Thereupon
I myself bought the books and sent them to Heidelberg,
that they may be read there.

And Ι trow that when the Heidelbergers see them
they will rue that they did not join hands with the
benign University of Cologne against Doctor Reuclzlin.

Moreover I learn that the University of (sologne
hath made a statute ordaining that never, world with-
out end, will it grant a degree to any man who has
qualified as Bachelor or Master at Heidelbeyg. And a
good thing too3 for this will learn them what the
University of Cologne is, and to take part with her
another time. W ould that you had de· tlt so with the
rest, but I ween the other Universities knew naught
of the 111 ztter, and you spaled them on the score eof
ignorance.

A friend has given me some mighty pretty verses
which you must have published in the University of
Colo gne. l have shewn them to the M201ste1s and Doc-

tors, and they were highly lauded. And to your glory I
hax e sent them to many p 11 ts f01 am I not on your side ἲ
