—he has even laid hands on the obscure Men them-
selves, classifying and labelling them like ghostly butter-
flies. Herr Brecht's work has, in fact, been admirably
done, and it need never be done again. We take the
case as proved.

To Crotus belongs the origination of the design-if
indeed its germ was not rather a spark struck from the
casual collision of many minds—and the first forty-one
letters of the first series are probably from his pen alone.
To Hutten belong the Appendix to the first series, and
the whole of the second series—abounding as it does with
Italian allusions. Once the clue is in the reader's hands,
he will have little difficulty in recognising the respective
styles of the two writers. Crotus, as a satirist, is the
more humorous and the kindlier: if he impales his
victims, he at the same time anticipates the gentle
Angler's advice to “treat them as though he loved
them.’' Hutten’s contributions breathe on the whole
a fiercer spirit. His bitter wit at times stabs like a
poisoned dagger. He seems in deadly earnest when he
is attacking abuseS. More than once he ascends the
pulpit‚ and speaks plain words of eloquent remon-
strance ;¹ his seriousness of purpose, in fact, peeps out,
now and then, a little too obviously.

NevertheleSS, we must not pass over in silence
Erasmus's distinct assertion2 that the authors of the
Epistolae were three in number, and that he knew who
they were. This plain statement, which was made
‘⁴ under circumstances in which it was no longer a point
of delicacy to dissemble his knowledge,” cannot be
simply ignored. Still, while two distinct styles are
plainly manifest in the Epistola& not more than two
seem recognisable. This circumstance does not, how-
ever, preclude the co-operation of a third person, or of
several persons, in sketching ideas on which Letters
might be based, or supplying jests and quips to be
worked in by the actual authors But if any confrere
did more than this, and might therefore be regarded as
completing Erasmus’s trio, it was Hermann von dem
