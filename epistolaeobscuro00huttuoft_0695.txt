UCH wondrous boasts and such soaring scurrilitieS‚
Herr Orth'n, have Ι never heard in my whole life
as those put forth by yourself and the Doctors of
Cologne—saving your presence—against that most
honourable and learned of men, Herr Joleann Reuclzlin.
Nevertheless when I heard thereof great wonder pos-
sessed me—seeing that you are all double-headed asses,
and natural philosophers, to wit born fools, “zwanzig
zentner iiber einen tollen Fantasten”-—that you strive
so meanly and so scurvily to assail men so pious and
learned. Moreover I marvelled greatly who taught
you so eraftily to pervert and falsify the pious opinions
of such an upright man. At last I eoncluded in my
mind that it could be none other than one sprung
from the seed of ‹Iudas—like father like son—and of
such is Jolzamz Pfeffkrkoru. Small wonder that ye are
all friends of this man, for “birds of a feather floek
to ether.'’
gTo the gallows then with you all, to a man, whither
the hangman and his men will hale you, while you
howl ‘⁶ Pray for us!” Now inasmueh as all these my
words are very sooth, I address them to you privately
and especially, and you may impart them to the rest
who sit with you in the seat of the seornful, as saith
the Psalmist. But let not these matters be published
abroad, lest all the righteous discern what manner of
men e are.

N{vertheless‚ by all the saints! a great dread falleth
upon me; a fear lest the printer hath stolen a copy of
my letter—for, if this be 5ο, God help you! Then I
ean in no wise hinder it. Yet will I give you good
