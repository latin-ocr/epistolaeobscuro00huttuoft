LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

logian as being well-lettered, and a Doctor of long
standing, and a profound Scotist, and deeply versed in
the Book of the Sentences.

You also averred that he had conned by rote the
whole book of the Holy Doctor “Of Entity and
Essence‚” and that he knew “ The Fortress of Faith'’
like his paternoster, and that by memorative art he
had impressed the Formalities of Scotus upon his
mind like so much wax3 and, finally, you alleged that
he was ‘⁶ a member of ten universities.”

You commit—pardon me—a solecism. One
member cannot have many bodies; but, on the other

Thus, the human body hath a head, feet, hands,

But none of these members consists of many bodies.
On the other hand, if you were to aver that a certain
Doctor was a body of ten Universities, I should still
censure you. For any one might hence conclude that
the ten Universities were members of that Doctor, and

sities‚ and they would be vilified if a single man—for
even Doctors of Divinity‚ as you know, are men—was
declared to be more worthy than so many Universities.
It is an impossible case. For even the Holy Doctor
himself is not greater than ten UniversitieS.

How then shall we mend the matter? What should
we rightly say?

Perpend3 for the question is mightily intricate, and
although it appertaineth to Grmnmar, yet many a
Doctor knoweth not how to resolve it :—

A man who has been matriculated at ten Univer-
sitieS‚ who has studied therein for the appointed time——
attending lectures and observing the statutes—when
he has taken and kept the oaths, and has rendered
honour to the Masters and Doctors‚ is entitled to
