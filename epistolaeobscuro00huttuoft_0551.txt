GT. MA GIS1 'ER J ΟΗΑ NN H UTER sendetla
greetc'ng to Magister Ortwin Gratius,-

NINCE it is written in the Evangel: “In what
b measure ye meten it shall be meten again to you‚” it
becometh me not, therefore, to write to you, seeing that
you write not to me. Nevertheless I know of what
moment it is that Ι should send you tidings from Rome,
to wit, how it fareth with Doctor Jahob vem H oogstrczten
—that man of zeal unimpeachaffle, who defendeth the
Catholic saith against those Jurists and secular Poets
who have not the fear of God before their eyes, as have
the Theologians in Cologne and Paris who burnt J olzmm
Reuelzlz‘n’s Augenspiegel. Though it would be but meet
that l should do unto you even as you do unto me·—
and not write you a single drop; nevertheless this I
will not do, but will yet this once favour you, on
condition that you forthwith send me a reply.

You must know, then, that those Jurists and adver-
saries, with the help of the Devil, the enemy of the
Christian Faith‚ have by their wiles—as is piously
believed—suborned a swarm of allieS‚ more especially
curialists of high rank—who have no scruples of con-
science; and they inflict grievous injuries on the
aforesaid Doctor‚ baiting him like a very bejan, and
declaring that he is himself a heretic, and the Theo-
logians of Cologne mere jack-puddings. Sonty ἱ What
is to be said ἓ Is it not marvellous that Sacred T heology
should be thus vilified‚ and held as trash, and that the
Theologians who are, as it were, the Lord’s Apostles
should be despised as so many fools? Mark my words l
There will hence be much scathe to the Catholic Faith‚
