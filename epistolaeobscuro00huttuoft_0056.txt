commission.1 The learned Jews at Rome prudently
kept in the background‚ rightly supposing that their
overt action on Reuchlin's behalf would prejudice his
case. That Reuchlin was in correspondence with
them seems⁵ however, certain, and a letter from him,
in Hebrew, to Bonet de Lates‚ the pope’s Hebrew
bodyzphyskfian‚is extant. zxnd so the case dragged
slowly on. Little else could be expected. As a
courtier remarked to one of the ‘⁵ Obscure Men‚” ‘⁶ If
Reuchlin has any money, he had better send it: at
the Curia money must be forthcoming or nothing can
be done.” ²

We must not here attempt to follow all the cross-
currents of intrigue indicated by the somewhat volumi-
nous correspondence of that day which yet survives, but
we cannot omit mention of the fact that Maximilian
himself appealed earnestly to the pope on Reuchlin⁷s
behalf.3 Dating his letter ‘⁶ Inspruck, Oct. 23, 1514‚’'
the emperor comments with considerable warmth on
the unfairneSS‚ not to say the illegality, of ‘⁶ this parcel
of Professors at Cologne” in daring to ignore the
decision of the Bishop of Speyer, “his well-beloved
cousin‚” and continuing to harass a truly honourable‚
learned, pious, and orthodox inan. He urges the pope
to quash the proceedings‚ and thus “to free a wholly
innocent man from these vindictive accusationS‚ and
permit him to spend the rest of his days in peace, and
at liberty to devote his talents to matters of real im-
portance to the Christian Commonwealth.'' Maxi-
milian, it is true, partly explains his sudden interest
in the matter by adding that “these captious Theo-
logians have even dared to cast a slur upon ourselves,
and otherS‚ our liege PrinceS.'’
