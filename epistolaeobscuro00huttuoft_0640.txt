To this it is objected that St. Thomas is called “ Holy,”
not as being absolutely holier than all other 3311113, but
merely as being the holiest of the canonized Doctors.
Hence he is not holier than St. Dominio. But an aged
member of our Order hath told me that he will show
me a very ancient book in which disputation con—
cerning the relative sanctity of these two saints is
prohibited. VVherefore I dismiss this question, and
pronounce not my judgment thereon.

You ask me, in the third place, whether I think
ιῙοΙιαηη Pfeff'erlrorn will persevere in the Christian
Faith. Ι answer that, by the Lord, Ι know not what
to say. It is a mighty ticklish point. You will call
to mind that precedent at St. Andreu’ s in Cologne—
how a Dean of that Church, who was a baptized Jew,
abided long in the Christian Faith, and liv ed an up·
right life. But upon his death-bed he ordered a hare
and a hound to be brought to him and enlarged,
whereupon the hound in a trice seized the hare. Then
he ordered a cat and a mouse to be brought—and the
cat pounced 011 the mouse. Then said he to many who
were standing around, “ You see how that these 3111111313
cannot cast off their natures; and a J ew can never cast
off his saith. Wherefore to-day Ι would fain die a true
Israelite,'' and so speaking he died. Thereupon the
citizens of Cologne in memory of this event set up
the brazen images which still stand on the wall before
the cemetery. Ι have heard, 100, of another Jew who
in like manner upon his death—bed commanded a large
stone to be brought, and to be placed in a pot full of
water beside the fire. After it had stood there quite
three days he asked whether it was yet cooked. They
answered, ‘⁶ Nay‚’' for it was not possible that a stone
should be cooked. Then said he, “As that stone can
never be sodden by the 11631, 30 can Jews never be
turned into true Christians. But they are baptized
for gain's sake, or through fear, or to work some
treachery. And to—d‘iy Ι will die a faithful Jew⁷’
And therefore, by the Ι 01(1, 111616 13 much to be
fealed concerning Jolzame Pscffiffmn, 1110111Ἴ rh Ι trust
that God will grant him espcci 11 grace and keep him
in the saith, and at any rate it 1161101 63 113-011 account
