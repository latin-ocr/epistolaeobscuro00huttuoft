IN TRODUCTION

in 1510 there appeared under his name, in German and
Latin, a pamphlet,1 in which “ Praise and Honour ’⁷ of
the emperor served as an introduction to a brief account
of what had already been done in the way of suppress-
ing Hebrew literature. The fifth chapter, it is true,
contained a list of the writings the Jews were still
graciously permitted to possess, but as this consists
merely of the names of the various books of the Bible,
transcribed in very faulty Hebrew, the writer succeeded
in displaying his ignorance rather than his tolerance.
Meanwhile it had been announced under an imperial
rescript, that the Jews might, at least for the time
being, keep their books, provided that they made no
use of them for proselytising purposeS, and the whole
controversy seemed likely to be forgotten, when Maxi-
milian was moved, either by secret influence or mere
vacillation, to issue yet another mandate, dated F'i'issen
(Bavaria)‚ July ⁶26, 1510. The purport of this was
similar to that of the second rescript, with an important
exception that throws some light upon the reason of
the latter having proved abortive: the same universi-
ties and eminent men were to be consulted, but there
was to be no conference, and the opinions were to be
collected by Archbishop Uriel. Pfefferkorn was to act
as the emperor’s ‘⁶ sollicitator‚’' and to report progress
from time to time. One of the advantages of a ‘⁶ Royal
Commission” had evidently dawned upon the emperor.
With the reports of the universities we need not
greatly concern ourselves. They were all more or less
in accord upon the advisability of suppressing the
Talmud‚·2 and writings directly or indirectly subversive
of Christianity. With regard to details there was
a good deal of titubation, as was natural in view of
the fact that the critics had to deal with books that
were sealed to them. Reuchlin’s carefully reasoned
Opinion, sent by command to the prelate‚ was,
however, of quite a different character. He brought-
his cultured and judicial mind to bear on a subject
with which it was peculiarly competent to deal. ,I-ri
