LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

vocal term. First, as applied to the Bohemians, who
go about with long hoods down to their middles, and
yet have no learning, but, rather, heresy. Seeondly,
as applied to the Jews, who also are eowled, and yet
are ignorant, for they are without the pale of the
Chureh. Thirdly, as applied to Magister—nostem, who
are illuminated— but not in the highest degree.
Fourthly‚ as applied to monks3 and they have know-
ledge supereminent, as you have.

I beseech you, therefore, aid that monk--for you
also are of his party, being cowled after the third
fashion——that he may defend his writings against
VVimplceling. For I hear that le'mpleelmg hath many
followers‚ and those at Strasbmg were lately named to
me. There is one Jalfflb Sturm‚ a noble, who is said to

who knoweth Greek as well as Reuelclhz, and can quote

in nine partieulars, and that he is a misohievous wind-
bag, as Tritlaemius himself hath averred in a letter to
Hieronymus Tungersleez‘m of Oelcsergf'zcrt—-and that it is
a great shame for anybody to waste paper and ink,
and time too, as he hath done. They also deelare that
St. Jerome once wrote to a monk as followeth: ‘⁶ Never
let the Psalter depart from your hand or from before
your eyes 3 ’' yet if this were true the prohibition would
be binding continually and for ever. And it would
follow that monks ought to do nothing save read the
Psalter. This I am sure is untrue, for St. Jerome him-
self was a monk, and would not write against them. I
lately heard a woundy long rigmarole from a disciple
of Wimplaeling. I said boldly to his face, ‘⁶ Your
master, lVinqoleeling, erreth greatly, who hath written
in opposition to the Abbot Tritleemius, and against
the monks, who are notable both for their learning and
