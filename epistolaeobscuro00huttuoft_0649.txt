11. 50] ADOLFUS CLIN GE SOR

accused no man falsely, nor has he attacked the life or
reputation of any man by word or deed. Hearken
once more—what mean the words that follow, ‘ Break
into your sheepfold’? Benclclin, good man, never
entered the University of Cologne—never, indeed, did
he pay any heed to the Theologians or the Church at
Colognez for he was occupied with more useful matters.
Therefore it is impossible to reckon him as one of the
ravening wolves of whom Liclztenberger speaketh; for
such must be found in the Colognese sheepfold. Then
followeth‚ ‘For in your days strange and unheard of
things shall arise.' ‘ Strange and unheard of ’ is good.
For neither hath eye seen nor ear heard, nor hath it
entered into the heart of man, that so learned and up-
right a man, who hath profited so many and done hurt
to none, should, in his old age, be so cruelly and so
treacherously harassed and tormented and persecuted.
Then, too, the words that follow, ‘in your churches'
cannot by any possibility be applied to Reuclzwlin, for,

will tear those wolves that lay waste God’s fold, and
will purge the Church of God '—that is, drive out those
base and lewd theologians who know nothing and boast
to know all thingS.” Now when he had done speaking
I departed from him, and swore by all that is holy that
I would write to Cologne. Ι therefore humbly entreat
you to report these things to the MagisternosterS, and
to Jolzann Pfefferlcorn, who iS, as it were, the mouth-
piece of the Colognese, and wondrously skilled in com-
position—and let him trounce the fellow soundly with
his pen. The man who said these things is a native of
Berlin. If you wish to learn his name, send me word,
and Ι will tell yOU. He once resided at Bonn, where
he was strictly disciplined‚ nevertheless he continues to
speak against the T heologians and is no good Christian
—he abideth in wickedneSS, and will therefore perish in
hell—from which may God preserve you, and the Theo-
