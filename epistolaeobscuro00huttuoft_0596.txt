LETTERS OF OsssoURE MEN

what opinion you hold eoneerning one who on a Friday‚
that is on the sixth day of the week—-or on any other
fast-day—should eat an egg with a ehieken in it ’ἕ

For you must know that we were lately sitting in
an inn in the Campo clei Fiori, having our supper, and
were eating eggs, when on opening one I saw that
there was a young ehieken within.

This Ι showed to a comrade3 whereupon quoth he
to me, ‘⁶ Eat 11 up speedily, before the tavei-ner sees it,
for if he mark 11, you will have to pay a Carline or a
Julius for 11 fowl. For it is the rule of the house that
once the landlord has put anything on the table you
must pay for it—he won't take it back. And if he
sees that there is a young fowl in that egg, he will say
⁶ Pay me for that fowl i' Little or big, ’tis all 0116.”

In a trice Ι gulped down the 699, ehieken and all.

And then I remembered that it was F riday!

W hereupon Ι said to my erony, “ You have made
me commit a mortal sin, in eating flesh on the sixth
day of the week !''

But he averred that it was not 11 mortal sin—nor
even a venial one, seeing that such a chiekling is
aeeounted merely as 1111 699, 1111111 11 15 110111.

Η6 told me, too, that it is just the same in the 61156
of cheese‚ in which there are sometimes grubs‚ as there
are in eherries, 116115, and new beans: yet all these may
be eaten on F ridays, and even on Apostolie Vigils.
But taverners are such raseals that they eall. them flesh‚
to get the more money.

'l'hen l departed‚ and thought the matter over.

And by the Lord‚ Master Oriza-in, I am in 11 mighty
quandary, and know not what to do. ⁷

1 would willingly seek eounsel of one of the Cour-
116111115, 11111 they are not ‹levout men.

It seemeth to me that 111656 young fowls in 6995 1116
116511,1166111156 111611 substance 15 formed and fashioned
into the limbs and body of 1111 11111111111, and possesseth a
vital principle.

lt 15 different in the 61156 of grubs in 6116656, and
such-like, because grubs are accounted 11511, 115 Ι learnt
from a physieian who is also skilled in Natural
Philosophy.
