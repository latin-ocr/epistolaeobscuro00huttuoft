1. 24] PAUL DAUBENGIGEL

the wiles of the Devil and the thorn in the flesh3 seek‚
too, in your prayers that you may be preserved from all
evil thoughts. It is my belief that you have been read-
ing about such things in the heathen poets, andr ‚are
corrupted thereby. would that you might cast away
all their works‚ for you know that St. J erome himself was
smitten by an angel for reading a book of poetry. At
Deventer Ι often urged you not to become a Poet or a
J urist, for such men are evil-affectioned towards the
Faith‚ and almost all are loose livers. Concerning them
the Realmsist saith : “Thou hast hated them that regard
vanities to no purpose.’'

There is another matter on which I have a mind to
counsel you. The rumour goeth that you have written,
in defence of the Faith‚ against J oleamz Rem-lilia. This
is well enough, if you would use to your profit the talent
that God hath given you. But it is reported here that
Jolzann Rfiffirlrorn, the man whom you buttress, is a
worthless knave, and became not a Christian for love of
the Faith, but, because the Jews would have fain have
hanged him for his wrong doings—for they say he is a
thief and a traitor-—he was baptized to save himself. And
all aver that at heart he is a sorry Christian, and will not
abide in the Faith. Therefore take heed what you do.
Already they have burnt at Halle another baptized J ew,
also named ιῙοΙιαηφι chffkrlcorn, for his many evil deeds.
Ι sear me that this fellow will tread in his steps, and
then you will be in a quandary.

Nevertheless‚ continue to defend Theology, and take
in good part my brotherly counsel. Fare ye well, in all
prosperity.
