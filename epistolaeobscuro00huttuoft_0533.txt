1. 47] WENDELIN TUCHSOHERER

intituled “A Catalogue of Prevaricators,” that is, of
Predicants—and that he would lay bare all their mis·
deeds, inasmuch as of all Orders they were the most
iniquitous. In the first place he would relate how that
at Berne the Prior and the Superiors introduced harlots
into the Convent, and how they produced a new St.
Francis, and how the Blessed Virgin and other Saints
appeared to one *Volllzardma and how afterwards the
monks would fain have given the said AVollltccrden poison
in Christ’s body, and how that for all the follies and
crimes that the monks had committed they went as they
deserved to the stake.

Next, he would relate how that at sslae'nz a Domi-
nican had knowledge of a trollop in the CathedraL
anear the altar—whence it came to pass that the other
drabs had a spite against her, and called her “monk-
mort‚” and “ quire·quean‚” and “ altar-picce’'—so that
it came to folks' ears, and she is thus named unto
this da .

Heywould relate, too, how that once at fllainz, at
the sign of Tlae Crown, when the Predicants from
Augsburg lodged at that inn to sell their indulgences,
one of their number would fain have forced a serving-
maid who prepared his bed, and he pursued her and
threw her to the ground, but she cried out, and men
ran to her rescue, else would she have served his turn.

-And, finally, he would relate how that here at
Strasbmg there were monks in the Monastery of the
Preachers who brought women-folk to their cells by
way of the river beneath their walls 3 and they trimmed
their hair, so that for a long while they passed for monks,
and went to market‚ and bought fish from their husbands
the fishermen‚ but at the last they were unmasked.
For in like manner the Predicants wrought evil among
the vagrant scholars——and once when a Predicant went
a-walking with a monkess, they came nigh unto the
schools, and the scholars dragged them both into the
school and set to work to chastise thern soundly; but
when they would have drubbed the monkess they un-
covered her shame, and with laughter let them both
depart in peace 3 but the whole town rang with tidings
of these things.
