LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Hoogstraten arrived here, and Ι posted it on Pasquz'n’s
statue in his honour—for he is an eminent man, and
defendeth the Catholic Faith against many a heretic.
The ode runneth thus 2——

AN ODE,

Upon tlte solemn entry of the Rem-end F ather ιῙαΙεοΙ) van Hoogstraten, of
the Order of Preachers, Magistemoster (md Inquisitor of Heretical
Pravz‘ty .· By BIagister W z'llzelm Storclz of Devenler.

Be it known to all—both young and old, by these presents,
’ 'lhat a grave Divine‚ immersed in learning profoundly,
Hath to the city come, and with‹ great solemnity stalketh,
’ Jakob van Hoogstraten y· -:clept this also his name is.
He from Ger-many came, where he abounded in cheeses
Which he collected in heaps—until at last at a Uni-
Versity he a degree Theological haply attained to3
2 Crastily could he dispute, syllogisms subtly devising
In Baroco and Celarent, till all the world wondered.
This Theologians marked, and they in the Faith being zealous‚
’ Made him Inquisitor ’gainst Heretical Pravity. If you
Ask, saying, “ What doeth here this man so mighty in learning ? ''
χ Lend me your ears awhile, and I will shew you the reason.
³ There is in Germany now another Doctor—a Jurist,
³ Johann Reuchlin his name, and him the Inquisitor cited
Here at Rome to appear, because he lately indited
A book of Theology void, but crammed with heresy hurtful ;
'Gainst the Faith it hat-h a heap of scandalous theses,
And——be it known to all—it likewise cockers the Hebrews;
Therefore suspect it was, and, by th’ Inquisitor tested,
It to the fire was doomed--to recantation, its author,
(Would you know its name? The Augenspz'egel its title.)
Now the Inquisitor grave hath hither come on the matter—
No delay nor rest would the Theologians allow him.
Swift to Rome must he fare, and rend that Jurist to tatters.
Therefore is honour his due, and reverent low salutations
’ WVhen he walked abroad——for he is a disputant stalwart,
’ And in Logic few are worthy his latchet to loosen.

They say that this is not composed according to
mle, and limpeth upon its feet. “What have Ι to do
with feet?'' say I. I am not a heathen poet, but a
TheologicaL and I care not for such childishness3 ’tis
the sense Ι heed. therefore, Herr Orth'n, it be-
hoveth you to answer this my composition, and deliver
your letter at the bank.

But I have some news for you. Some men called
