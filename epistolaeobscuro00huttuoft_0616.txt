LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Scripture in Genesis, “Their eyes were blinded‚ and
they could not see.”

A baehelor lately came hither from Stnttgart, who
had been in his house, and Ι made as though I knew
not of the strife you had with each other, and asked
him, saying, ‘⁶ Prithee‚ Herr Bachelor, take it not amiss
that Ι question you. In the first place, by your favour,
Ι would inquire whether Re‘zcclclz'n is in good health.''
‘⁶ Yea,’⁷ replied he, ‘⁶ but he cannot see very well with-
out spectacles.” Then said Ι, “And will you next
tell me what he is now doing in the business of the
Cause of the Faith? Ι have heard that he had some
dispute with certain Theologians, and Ι trow they
did him some injury;’' (but Ι spake in irony), “what
doeth he? I take it he is for ever composing some-
what against the Theologian8.'' “I know not‚’' he
answered, “but I will tell you what I saw myself.
When Ι entered his house, he said, ‘VVeleomQ Herr
Baehelor! Be seatedl' He had speotaoles upon his
nose, and a book lay before him in strange characters,
so that 1 could see at once that it was written neither
in German nor in Bohemian, nor in Latin. And Ι
said to him, ‘Most excellent Herr Doctor‚ how name
you this book ξ’ He replied that it was called Plutarch
in Greek, and dealt with Philosophy. T hen said I,
‘ Read on, in the Lord's name.' And I verily believe
he is skilled in magical artS. Then I espied a little
book, newly imprinted, lying beneath his seat. And
I said to him, ‘Most excellent Herr Doctor, what is
this book that lieth here2’ He replied, ‘It is a
scurrilous work that a friend of mine lately sent me
from Cologne; it is aimed at me, and the Theologians
of Cologne compiled it, deelaring it at the same time
to be the work of ιῙοΙιαηη ΕῙξῇὲνᾸῸνηῖ Then said
I, ‘What will you do eoneerning it? Will you not
vindicate yourself2' ‘By no means‚’ he replied, ‘I
am already vindieated. I pay no further heed to
such folly, and my eyes scarcely suffice me for study-
ing matters of use to me.’ The book was intituled
‘ J ohann Pfefferkorn's Defenee against Calumnies‚ &c.’
That is all I know of Doetor Rem-hilm? And this
is all that the aforesaid Baebelor told me. Therefore
