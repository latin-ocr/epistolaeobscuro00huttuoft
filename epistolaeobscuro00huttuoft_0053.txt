his reckless heterodoxy, his neo-Platonic phantasieS‚
learnt from Pico, Politian, and Marsilio Ficino——his
eulogies of the Koran-his merry scoffs at the pedantry
that passed for learning—and his biting sarcasms on
the corruption of the Church and of cloistered life,

a century later round Lord Falkland on the lawns
and terraces of Great Tew. As at Erfurt, men of
learning, wit, and above all of liberal mind there for-
