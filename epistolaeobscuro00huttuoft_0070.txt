INTRODUCTION

The issues of the Epistolae that appeared in 1517
were the last to be published for nearly forty years,
but in 1556 both parts of the work appeared sor the
first time in a single volume.1 In the eyes of the
new generation which had arisen it belonged to an age
already half forgotten. The Reformation in Germany
had run its course. The dawn that the Epistola&

An adequate discussion of this would altogether
exceed our limits, and demands a volume to itself.
Fortunately for the student who wishes to probe the
matter deeply, such a volume has very recently been
provided by Herr VValther Brechtz³ in this work
the methods of the “Higher Criticism” are applied
to the problem with great patience and ability, and
it is somewhat consoling to find that Brecht's solution
differs but slightly from that arrived at by a similar
method, some eighty years ago, at the hands of Sir
xsVilliam Hamilton. ’

F or three centuries the authorship of the Epistolcoe
was involved in an obscurity greater than that which
enwrapped the Letters of szz‘us. We can scarcely
give a better idea of the chaotic welter of critical
opinions upon the subject which formerly prevailed, than
by briefly suminarising the pre-Hamiltonian theorieS.

At least twenty-eight writers assigned the Epistolae
to a single author, and made their choice from a list
