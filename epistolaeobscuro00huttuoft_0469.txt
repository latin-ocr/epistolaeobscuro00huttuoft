and say that their way is better than that of the
Aneients, and our University will be defamed, and will
become a laughing—stoek.”

Then Magister Α mlrew Dele'tzsele, who is a fine poet
himself, said that Aaeticampiamas· at the University was
like a fifth wheel to a eoaeh—for he thwarted the other
Faculties, so that the students could not graduate
therein. And the other Masters were of the same
mind, so the long and the short of it was that they
determined to either expel or inhibit that poet, at the
risk of his everlasting dudgeon. Thereupon they cited
him before the Rector, and nailed the citation on the

Then the fellow put in an appearance—an advocate

Then the Duke was persuaded, and avouehed that
he might not oppose the University, and that it was
expedient that one man should be expelled, rather than
that the whole University should suffer disgraee. The
Magisters then were fully content, and eried: ‘⁶ Heaven
be thanked, Lord Duke, for this thy righteous judg-
ment!’' Then the Rector fastened a decree to the
