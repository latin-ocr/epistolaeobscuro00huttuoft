us reverence—-and unless we were of the better way
they would not do us reverence.' And thus they are
confirmed in their own creed, and despise the Chris-
tian saith, and will not be baptized.” 'l'hen Ι replied,
“ That is true enough, when the deed is done wittingly;
but Ι did it in ignorance, and ignorance excuseth sin.
For if I had known them to be JeWS‚ and had never-

deserving of the stake, for it would have been heresy.
But, heaven knoweth, neither from word or gesture

Still he declared that it was, nevertheless, a sin, and
he added, “I myself was once walking in a church

seen as well as Ι; wherefore your ignorance is crass,
and of no avail towards absolution of your sin.'’

All this the Bachelor told me.

Now, seeing that you are a profound theologian‚ Ι
beg of you, earnestly and humbly, that you will deign
to resolve this my question, and tell me whether this sin
is mortal or venial, and mine an ordinary, or an episco-
