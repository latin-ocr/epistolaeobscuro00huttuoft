INTRODUCTION

and, it must be added, immorality. They are allowed,
to use Bishop Creighton's words, “to tell their own
story, to wander round the narrow circle of antiquated
prejudices which they mistook for ideas, display their
grossness, their vulgarity‚ their absence of aim, their
laborious indolence, their lives unrelieved by any touch
of nobility.”1 Pascal in the following century em-
ployed this device of sels-revelation, with exquisite
wit, in the Provincial Letters——but we must go back
perhaps to Aristophanes to find a parallel in previous
literature. It is, in fact, evident that this method of
satire is essentially dramatic—and the dramatic art
evinced is of a high order. The Obscure Men live
before us upon the stage—they are made to unfold
their characters as well as those of their correspondents
through their own words. The fool exposes his folly
in some artless request for information or guidance3
the dull‘sensualist brags of a sordid amour—excusing
himself because Magister Ortwin is similarly frank;
the vain ignoramus exults in the acuteness with which
he has overthrown an opponent on some childish gram-
matical point, while at the same time he is careful
to tickle Ortwin’s sels-complacency by consulting him
upon the subject.

The lover of true humour, in the sense in which
we understand the word to-day--the humour of Fal-
staff, of Pecksniff, and even, in its daintiest form, of
Elia—will find strange foretastes of this essentially
modern literary gift in the rich and varied Comedy
of the Obscure. When we compare the Epistola&
with Tlae Shz'p of Fools and the Praise of Folly we
cannot help feeling that a gulf separates the first·
named from the other two almost contemporary satires.
The distinction, though irresistibly felt, may seem hard
to define, until it flashes upon us that the works of
Brandt and Erasmus, with all their enlightenment‚ are
essentially medieval in treatment, while the Epistola&
are modern through and through. We seem, in fact,
to have found a region upon the chart of Literature
