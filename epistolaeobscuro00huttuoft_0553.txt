11. 5] JOHANN VON WERDAU

he in turn forbid? Yea, of a truth——for his Holiness
hath power to loose and to bind, and is not on that
account blameworthy. Hath he not plenary powers,
here and everywhere, as you know from the Evangel,
for you are wondrously versed in Holy Scripture?
Furthermore l can cite thereon the Canon Law: First,
the Pope hath sway over the whole world, Quest. IX.
Clzap. 4, “Cuncta per mundum‚” &c He can depose
the Emperor, alone, without a Council, as saith the
gloss on the Chapter, “Ad apostolicae, de sententia
et re judicata.’' Compare also Quest. VI. Clmp. 100,
“ De cetero.” Moreover the Pope is not subject to the
Law, but is himself the living Law upon the Earth3
as saith the gloss on Clefccp. XL, “De officio Judic.
delegati.'’ And since the Pope is the Law, he can do
whatsoever he listeth, and heedeth no man. If, there-
fore, he saith at one time ‘⁶ Yea‚” nevertheless he can
afterwards say “Nay.’' Be then of good coumge, for
I lately heard from one of the judges of the Rota—a
notable man, and of wide experience—that it is not
possible that the Pope will pronounce sentence against
you, for yours is the best of Causes, the Cause of the
Faith.

Be ye therefore valiant in battle; and whatever
those noddies may say to you about the Inhibition‚
credit it not, for it goeth for naught. I trust that I
may soon be able to send you good tidings‚ for Herr
Doctor Jalsob van Hoogstraten is doing his utter-
most. Lately he gave a banquet‚ and invited many
courtiers of years and experienee, and an Apostolical
Secretary who is in high favour with his Holiness‚ and
sundry judges of the Rota. He plied thern with par-
tridges, and pheasants, and hares, and fresh fish, and
the best Corsican and Greek wines. They all declared
that he had dealt with them most honourably‚ and said
among themselves, ‘⁶ By the Lord‚ we have here a
Theologian of consequence: We will be on his side.”

Now therefore he taketh heart of grace. But I must
stay my hand, for the messe-nger will no longer wait„

Farewell, and salute for me all the Doctors and
lssagisters, and J οἰιαηη chffirlcorn.

Roma.
