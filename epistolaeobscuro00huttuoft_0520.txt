declare that there is not so much in him as they say.
In the way of Poetry I admit that he can speak fair
Latin. But what of that? We can learn many such
things as that in a year. But in respect of the philo-
sophie scienceS‚ such as Theology and Medicine, much
more hath to be done if one would fain learn them.
And yet would he be held a Theologian. But, my

Theology——to which may God and the Holy Mother
exalt you. N evertheless‚ I will say this on my own

Erasmus· or any other Poet in a year. Let this, then,
suffice for the present. Good luck to you! Ι have

more news. May you live and prosper as long as doth
a phoenix—this may all the Saints grant—and have
affection for me as of yore.

the which you consoled me, inasmuch as you had
heard that Ι was sick, I render you sempiternal thanks.
Nevertheless you wrote in that letter that you mar-

velled at my being sick, since I had no more labour to
