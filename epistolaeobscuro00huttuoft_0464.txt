GT, WILHELM SCHEREMS'CHLEIFER

sendetle greeling to illm-ter Ortzcin Gratius·

MARVEL greatly, Reverend Sir, why you write

not to 1116, 111111 116116111161655 write to others who
write not to you 115 often 115 I write to you.

, If you are in dudgeon with 1116, and will not write
s to me again, at the least write 111111 tell me why you
, will not write to me again, that Ι might know why

you write not, although I am 61161· writing to you——
as I 11111 writing to you 110111, although Ι know you j
will not write back. ’

But I 116566611 you from my heart's core that you
will yet write to 1ne3 111111 when you 1111116 written to me
onee then Ι will write ten times to you, beeause I gladly
write to my friends, and Ι 10116 to exereise myself in
writing, 50 115 to be able to finely indite tractates and
letters.

Ι cannot think what 15 the reason why you write
not to 1116. 111116111, when there were 501116 folk here
from Cologne, l groped them 111111 11511611 them, ⁶· What
15 Master Ortzcin about, that he doth not write to 1116 :²
He hath not written for two 1161115; but bid him write
to 1116, for l would rather read 1115 letters than eat honey.
And on 11 time he 111115 11111 eliiefest f1·iend.”

Ι 11511611 them, too, how you sped in that 6011110-
versy with Doctor Ir'emsselin. And they replied that
that ι1111151 well knew how to circumvent you with his
craft. And then Ι 1111511611 that the Lord would give
you 1115 grace that you might triumph.

if you do write to 1116, you might write to me about
that affair, for Ι would gladly know more eoneerning
it. The Jurists strut about here 111111 say, “Doetor
Renehliu doeth well, and the 'l'heologians at Cologne
have 115611 111111 111.”

And, by the Lord, Ι sear nie that 11 great seandal
will befall the Chureh if that book, ‘· Tlec’ Egsqgla.5·3·‚''
be not burnt.
