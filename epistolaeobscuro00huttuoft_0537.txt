might find it; and it contained these verses :—

EPITA PH ON HOCHSTRATUS.

Hoc-hstratus dead—Craft, F ury, Spite, and Rage
With him die not, but still, with poison rife‚
Infect the witless herd3 his monument,

Sprung from the hellish seed he sowed in life.

A notker.

of mine, who is one of the grooms of the Cardinal of
S. Eusebius ; and he ean easily get the fellow sent to
prison on bread and water—to die there of the pestil-
