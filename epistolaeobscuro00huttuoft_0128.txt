EPISTOLAE OBSCURORUM VIRORUM

lactis et permittunt ancillas esse cum presbyteris, quia
deberent eas totaliter expellere. Sed sit a vel b, nos
debemus esse aliquando laeti, et etiam possumus dormire
cum mulieribus, quando nemo videt: postea tamen
facimus confessionem: et deus est misericors, et
debemus sperare veniam.

Ego mitto vobis hic quaedam scripta pro defensione
Alexandri Galli grammatici antiqui et sufficientis, quam-
vis poetae moderni volunt eum reprehendere3 sed non
sciunt quid loquuntur, quia Alexander est optimus, ut
olim dixistis mihi quando stetimus Daventriae. Quidam
magister hic dedit mihi, sed nescio ubi accepit. Ego
vellem quod faceretis imprimere, tunc maxime faceretis
iratos illos poetas, quia ille auctor realiter vexat eos;

τ sed est ita poetaliter compositum quod ego non intelligo,

quia ille qui composuit est etiam bonus poeta3 sed cum
hoc est T lieologuS‚ et non tenet cum saecularibus poetis
sicut est doctor Reuchlin, Buschius et alii. Statim

pel those priests who live continently
to pay the same tax, declaring that
the Bishop must have his money, and
that when the fine was paid they
could please themselves whether they
lived a life of celibacy or not.'' Gol-

⁷³ Bzwvhz'nx: Hermannus Buschius
—Hermann von dem ssussehe—(l468—
1534) was born at Sassenberg in
1Vest1)l]alia, and is described in the
Register of Cologne Univ. as “ eques-
tris ordinis.’' As a boy, he was a
pupil of Hegius at Deventer, where
116 was a fellow-student of Ortwin
Gratius. ln 1486 B. proceeded to
Italy, where he remained for five
years, and enjoyed the friendship of
the eminent scholar and antiquary,
Pomponius Laetus. In some verses
inscribed to the younger Filippo
Beroaldo, he says :—

“()lim Romanas juvenis digressus

ad arces

Pei-domiti clarum quae caput orbis
erant.

Pomponi Laeti primum ceu fonte
perenni

Plurima de sacro sedulus ore bibi.

Post lustrum patriae capior revo-
cantis amore

Et propriam Latia vertor ab urbe
domum.'⁷

ln the Register of 1Vittenberg Univ.
for 1502 Buschius is first entitled
“‘ Pasiphilus’'-qua.s³i πᾶσι φίλος -< a
name ever after associated with him.
The young scholar soon became
known as one of the most ardent
champions of the New Learning.
Attacking with the utmost vivacity
the err-ors and futilities of the
scholastic text-books, ever at logger-
heads with the defenders of medieral-
ism, Buschius flitted restlessly from
city to city throughout Ger-many
and the Netherlands. He did not,
however, at first throw in his lot
with the Rcuchlinists, and wrote an
Eloyium for von 'l‘ongern’s “Articuli. ''
But in 1514 Muti-anus writes gleefully,
“Buschius has sung his palino<le!”
and henceforward the latter is to be
found in the foreinost ranks of
Reuchlin’s defenders. In Oct. 1514
116 writes to Reuchlin :—

“ 0 ! si videres nunc ora et vultus
Theologistarum3 talis est furientis
invidiae specieS, talis est insaniae
delirantis viva effigies. Inflatis buccis
