11. 28] BERN HARD GELFF

Spaniards have invaded Lombarclffi· and it is said that
the Emperor would fain drive out the King of Fratue&
and this would be a bad thing for Doctor van Hoog-
straten, for it is through the King of Frcmce that he
advanceth his cause before his Holine55‚ and the King
of France doeth his utmost for him, for the honour of
the University of Paris, which would be disgraced if the
Augenspiegel were not burned. I know no more. Fare-
well‚ in all happiness.

From Rome.

GJ: MA GISTER BERNHARD GELFF, one of
the Zowliest, to Mag. Ortwin Gratius greetz'ng

“ ONOURABLE, or excellent Sir; notwithstand-
ing that I have not personal acquaintance of you,
I nevertheless know you by reputation, and for many
a day I have had cognisance of that Cause of yours
which is known as “The Cause of the Faith against
Jolzarm Reuclzlz'n,” and Ι have the whole process in my
ossessmn.
p Daily do Ι dispute with the Courtiers and the
scribes who defend Jolmnn Remmia, and when the
Cursor who bears these presents told me that he was
starting for Germany and would make his way through
Cologne, Ι said, “Then will Ι, by the Lord, make
acquaintance of Magister Ortwin and write somewhat
to him.” Then said he, ‘⁶ Ay, by the Lord, do so, and
he will be right glad. When I lest Cologne he charged
me, saying, ‘ Bid all the Theologians, and Doctors, and
Artsmen and Poets who are in Rome to write to me;
for gladly do Ι receive the missives that learned and
well-skilled men send me, and then Ι collect the letters
that they have written to me, and afterwards make a
volume of them, and have them printed.' ”. , ,„
Δ ’ΤΗΘΓΕΠΡΟΪΙ Ι Τ6Ρ116ᾶ,’ “I know that full well, 'for‘
I have seen a book entitled Epi-stolae Obscurorum
Virorum, and it greatly delighted me when I read it,
for it is mightily fine and containeth notable matters
&collected-from all quarters !'' ι
