LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

pontraf’ Then he shewed by a multitude of proofs
{that no man could attain a perfect knowledge of theology
{save through the holy spirit, and that the holy spirit was
{the well-spring of that art, and that poetry is the food
‘inf the devss, as saith Jerome in his Epistles.

'¹ Then the zany deelared that to be a lie, and that
Doetor Rem-Idm had the holy spirit too, and was duly
qualified in theology, seeing that he had written a right
theological book (lknowanotmwhat its nanjtssv ..,‚m,{le.1Pe),
and thereafter he called Magister Peter a beast. And
then he swore that Magister Hoogstrccten was naught
but a mumping, cheese-begging friar, and so set the
table on a roar; but Ι oried that it was a shameful
thing that a mere student should behave so irreverently
towards a Doetor of Divinity.

Thereupon Doctor Peter was so wrath that he rose
from thetable, and, quoting the Evangel, said: ‘⁵ Thou
art a Samaritan, and hast a devil 1” And I (tried :
“ Swallow that !'’ and was overjoyed because he had so
roundly trouneed that braggart.

You must persevere in your undertaking, and must
defend theology as you were wont——and you-wrruiust> have

If Ι knew how to write verses as thou dost, l would
not heed even the prince if he went about to slay me.

Ι hate those Jurists, too, who strut up and down
in red boots and marten-fur eloaks, and make not the
obeisanee, that would be fitting, to the Magisters and
Doetors.

Now Ι entreat you, humbly but affectionately, that
you will explain to me how the matter standeth at Paris
eoneerning the Augenspiegel. God grant that the
University of Paris, that alma mater, will hold with
you, and will burn that heretieal book—*for it eontaineth
many heretica] things, as Magister von Tongern hath
deelared.

I have heard that Magister von Zutphen, of Kozeelc
Hostel, who eompiled the notable eommentary on the
four parts of Aleoearzder‚ is dead. I trust, however, that
this is not true, for he was an eminent man and a pro-
found grammarian, and was far more skilled than these
new poetising grammaticasters.
