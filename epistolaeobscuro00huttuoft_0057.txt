INTRODUCTION

defendant would persevere in his defence. They were
prepared for a little preliminary expenditure, by way
of lubricating the legal machinery of the Curia—but
to regard an accusation brought by their omnipotent
Order as seriously arguable was in itself an insult. If
an inquisitor said a book was heretical, it was heretical
—and there was an end.

It is not an uncommon thing for sear to manifest
itself in the form of bluster and threats‚ and so it hap-
pened in the case of the Predicants. To be flouted by
a mere pope and emperor was more than they could
endure! What did they care for the emperor? He
had no authority over the Church. Even the pope was
not supreme; a pope's decision could be over-ridden
by a couneil. Nay, some of the more hot-headed even
threatened a schism, and there were dark hints of join-
ing forces with the Bohemian Brethren.l

All this was mere froth and fury-but the Order
had still an important card to play, and they now
played it for what it was worth.

Hitherto the Dominicans had sought for allies only
among the universities of Germany. Franee—or, at
all events, Paris—remained‚ and there they would not
seek in vain. The College of the Sorbonne was at the
height of its power, and it was practically identical
with the theologica] faculty of the great university
that then teemed with students. The Sorbonne, in
fact, assumed, if it did not overtly claim, infallibility‚
and it has been truly spoken of as being, not many
years later, ‘⁶ the refuge and fortress of the spirit of the
past—the stronghold where M ediaevalism fought its
last fight against the mighty men of the Renaissance.'’
To Paris, accordingly, the anti-Reuchlinists appealed.
All would be well if the Sorbonne did but condemn
Reuchlin and his Augenspz‘egel. Powerful influence
was at the same time exerted at the French court
through the agency of Guillaume Haquinet Petit—-
confessor to Louis XII„ as he also became to the suc-
cessor of that monarch. The political rivalry existing
between Louis and the emperor might reasonably be
reckoned as a factor not to be disregarded. Upon
