upon his way.

Howev er low m opinion we may form of Pfeffer-
kor’ns moral character and literary abilities, it is im-
possible to deny him credit for persev erance and skilful
audacity 'lhe caree1 of 'litus Oates reminds us that
it is by no means impossible for a man, infamous, but
courageous after a fashion, and entirely unscrupulous,
to bring about results utterly incommensulate with his
personal worth , and it must not be forgotten that in
Pfefferkorn’s case the vast but unobtrusive influence of
the Order of Preachers was at his back.

The upshot of the wrangle was that a second im—
perial mandate was issued,dated Roveredo,NovemberlO,
1509. Nominees of the Universities of Cologne, Mainz,
Heidelberg and Erfurt were to sit in solemn conclave
and examine all Hebrew books dealing with religious
subjects—a certain number of learned Jews being pre-
sent. As, however, a conference thus constituted could
have led to no results, save as an occasion of laughter
to the assembled rabbiS, certain assessors were also
named, viz„ Jakob van Hoogstraten—Inquisitor and
Dominican, Victo-rnjyon„„1{arben—a converted rabbi,
and Johann Reuchlin. Pfefferkorn was to exercise a
general supervision over their deliberations. For some
reason this conference never met.

Meanwhile unauthorised raids upon Hebrew litera-
ture were renewed. Many hundreds of manuscripts
were impounded at F rankfort, J ewish booksellers were
molested, and there was a rumour that the coming fair
would be made the occasion of a wholesale confiscation.
This contingency seriously alarmed the civic authori-
ties, Among the merchants attracted from all parts of
VVestern Europe to the great fairs were many vendors
of books, and they, like their fellow-chapmen, were
usually provided with some form of passport from their
native princes. Confiscation of their wares would be
likely to lead to political complications, and would cer-
tainly diminish the populaiity of an institution so lucra-
tive to the city as was the Franlfw--teo fllesse. The
zeal of the Dominicans was acc01dingly checked. Not
so the energy of the indefatigable Pfefferkoin. Early
