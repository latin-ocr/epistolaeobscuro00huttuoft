Other Doctors, too, she hath called ‘Bachelor’-take
heed therefore.’'

Thereupon her mother took a cudgel‚ and laid it
about her head and back till she beshamed herself;
and then she shut her up in her chamber for half a
year, and fed her on bread and water. In the mean-
while the Bachelor gained preferment, and celebrated
his first masS, and then received a cure of souls at
I’ardau in Samongy. But when the maiden heard
thereos she leaped from a lofty window and came nigh
to breaking her arm, and fled to Saxony, to the afore-
said Bachelor. She dwelleth with him unto this day,
and hath borne him four sons. You know right well
that this is a grievous scandal in the Church. Take
heed, therefore, and shun that Black Art from which so
many evils flow. But by all means use that recipe of
Gyni that Dr. Brunell hath prescribed. ’Tis a sovran
remedy, and I have ofttimes tried it against such

colicky spasms.

Most Theological of Tlaeologians, greetz'wg

YOU have written me, from Lomlon in Εφιςίαηιῖ, a
long letter excellently well Latinised‚ and in it
you adjure me to send you some tidings‚ whether good
or bad, since you are by nature inclined ever to be
hearkening to news—as are all men of a sanguine com-
plexion‚ who delight to hear the concords of sweet
music, and are of joyful heart at the board.

and was as one who findeth a precious pearl; and Ι
shewed it to Herren J olm Grocgsn and Limam-e, saying ε
“ See, my lords, see; is not this Doctor a paragon in
latinity, and composition, and the epistolary art?'’
