give. And as for his books, it is evident that he doth
but defend himself against Jolumn Renelzle‘n‚ who dis—

not intend alfwaysP to remain a Christian he would not
be so wrathful against the J ews, and do them so much
hurt. The priest said, “ To write, or compose, a book
is no small matter, and only great and learned men who
have taken high degrees are competent for this, not a
lewd fellow like Jolzarm Ifffqffkrlrorn .· and therefore the
Theologians of Cologne ought never to have thought
that they could persuade folk that Bsff‘brkom wrote

the like. If Ι were Emperor, Ι would hang chffi’r-
horn and Hoogstraten on the same gallows.’'

Quoth I, “What hath Doctor Jalcob van Hoog-
straten done? He is a good Imperialist‚ as Ι can
prove by his Letter to the Emperor, in the which he
saith ‘ May his Imperial Majesty prosper and rejoice for
ever 3 and may God preserve him for a thousand years.' ”

Quoth the priest, “I have seen ten malefactors
suffer death, and none of them was so worthy of death
as Hoogstraten, who persecuteth so unjustly a good
and innocent man ; moreover he hath sought the aid of
the King of F rauce, who is the Emperor’s open foe,
against Jolzann Rem-lilim. And this is the crime of
High Treason‚ over which he lamented at Rome.”

I replied that Hoogstrczten had done this through
zeal for the faith; for the faith is greater than an
Emperor, and theologians pay no heed to secular rank.
Then departed the priest, crying, “Oh most innocent
Reuclzlin! Why should you be harassed by these vile
and wicked persecutors? May God preserve you! If
there is any justice on Earth, you cannot be overthrown
in such a cause! Therefore can I say, ‘the heathen
have raged, and have imagined a vain thing.'” I
answered, in my sleeve, “Let his days be few, and
his bishoprick may another take.'' Pardy, Master
Orth'n, our troubles are many. Ι would that our
cause made way. Vv'rite to me how matters stand
at Rome. Farewell—for as long as lived ilsetlczcsela.
