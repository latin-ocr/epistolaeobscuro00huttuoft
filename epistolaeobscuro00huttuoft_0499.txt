too, what Magister Ortwin thinketh of it; and then Ι
will send it to the printer. Followeth :—

In pride presumptuous, who but a fool

From Bonswenture pregnant truths by rule
Would try to draw, or out of Holy Writ
Would seek enlightenment‚ while not a whit
He knoweth of the great Combibilations,

By learned Doctors taught to all the nationsZ
In every University professed,

But first in Paris—dam of all the rest.
Cologne divines, hamm’ring the question out,
By proof seraphic shewed, without a doubt,
Combibilations better 'tis to quote

Than ιῙενονηε and Angustiae con by rote—
(Although they scribbled Latin well enough.)
Combibilatz'ons are the primest stuff !

When Doctors in each Monast’ry eontend‚
With word divine Combibilatz‘ons end

The brabble—and they rummage to the root
Theology ε some other things they moot.

the goad whensoever any one goadeth thee: believe
