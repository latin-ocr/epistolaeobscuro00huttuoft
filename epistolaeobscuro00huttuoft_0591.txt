1123] BERTHOLD HACKERLING

this is why I longed for you to be with us yesterday.
But my father said, ‘'‘lhinkest thou that there are
no fish at Cologne. ?’' “Y‚'ea said Ι, “but they are
plaguy dear!”

You tell me that things go ill with you, and that
your cause prospereth not at Rome, and that Jolmm
Reuclclin's allies vex you sorely. Believe me, I grieve

curry- e-omb it, and keep it elean3 and that I must have
a care that he was ready to carry his master, with bridle
and saddle and so forth. And then it would be my
