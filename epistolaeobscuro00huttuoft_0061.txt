INTRODUCTION

Reasons for the selection of Ortwin Gratius as the
chief target for the satiric shafts of the Humanists
are not very far to seek.

Ortwin, only son of Federic von Graes, was
born at Holtwick, in westphalia. The Obscure Men,
however, hail him as Daventrz’ensz'5, for it was at the
famous school of Deventer that he was educated, at
the cost, as it appears, of his uncle Johann von Graes.
In 1501 Ortwin matriculated at Cologne, becoming
Magister in 1506, and at Cologne he resided till ’che‘
day of his death.

Now it was the Dominican party and the Faculty
of Theology at Cologne that the Epistolae were
primarily designed to attack: a sound literary instinct
pointed out the advantage of ensuring a certain unity
amid diversity by addressing all, or nearly all, the
Letters to the same person—and if to a real one it
would add zest. Some prominent Colognese don was
thus clearly indicated as the feigned recipient. Arnold
von Tongern was no doubt thought of, but Ortwin
was the better qualified, and, from the satirists’ point
of view, the more deserving of the two.

In the first place he waS, from the very outset,
implicated in the Pfefferkorn pamphletS. In fact there
were strong grounds for suspicion that, in a very real
sense, Ortwin was Pfefferkorn. It seemed not unlikely
that the scholar 1who contributed Latin verses to the
tracts, and translated four of them, was himself the
instigator of the whole series. His publication, in
1514, of the book usually cited as the Praenotamenta
classed him among the most militant and vindictive
opponents of Reuchlin: for this offence alone he
could have expected but little mercy. Furthermore,
Ortwin was hated and despised by the rising generation
of humanists in Germany, not only as an anti-
Reuchlinist pamphleteer, but as a renegade. Like
Mutianus Rufus and many another, he had enjoyed
the privilege of being a pupil of Alexander Hegius3
his scholarship was sound for the day, his Latinity
was respectable—his Fasciculus Rerum Expetendarum,
published twenty years later, was of value as a con-
tribution to ecclesiastical history—yet was his crime
