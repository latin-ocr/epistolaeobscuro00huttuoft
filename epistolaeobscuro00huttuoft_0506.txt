LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

And they vowed that they could not themselves write
such a letter in the Latin tongue, though poets, and
possessed both of Greek and Latin.

They extolled you, indeed, above all writers in
Englcmd, Frame and Germcmgy, and in every other
nation under heaven.

Small wonder then that you are Genera] of your
Order, and that in Frcmce the king loveth you ; for you
have no peer in Latinising, nor in disputation‚ nor in
preaching; and right well do you know how to instruct
the King and the Queen in the confessional.

The two poets aforesaid also lauded you, in that
- you were skilled in the art rhetorical; but there was
= a certain young man, Richard Croloe by name, who
'alleged against you that you did not write according
to the Canons of the Art of Rhetoric: but when he
made shift to prove his words he was put to confusion.

He is now at Leipsz'a studying the Logic of Peter
qf Spain: I trow in future he will be more heedful.

2} But, to corne to the news: The Swissers and the
§Landsknechts have been mightily waging war, and
{slaying one another in thousands; and it is to be feared
⁴ssffthat none of them will go to heaven, because they fight
{for pelf‚ and one Christian ought not to slay another.

.- 5- {But these are matters that you heed not; the soldiers

iare but lewd folk‚ and they fight because they list.

Another piece of news is graver—God grant that it
be not true—it is reported from Rome that Jolmmz
5¹Reucl12lz‘n's Augenspiegel hath been newly translated
“from the mother-tongue into Latin by the command
of my lord the Pope‚ and that in more than two
hundred passages it differeth in the Latin from the
rendering made by the Doctors and Herr Johamz
Efefferkorn at Cologne ,· they say too, for certain, that
it is openly read in Rome, and is printed with the
'l'almud of the Jews, And they conclude from this
that the Doctors are infamous falsffiers, because they
have translated ill ; also that they are asses, ignorant of
both Latin and German; and that as they burnt that
book at St. Andrew's in Cologmz so ought they to burn
their own V erdict‚ and the Verdict of Paris, or be
themselves held as heretica
