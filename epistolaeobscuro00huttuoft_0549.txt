and have any just cause against Reus-lehn, wherefore do
they not act for themselves? Why do they need a
baptized Jew to do their work for them, and why do
they write scandalous books against the worthy doctor,
and father them on that renegade? If they could have
lighted upon a viler or more malicious man in all Ger-
mangs they would have joined themselves to him Σ Yet
this is nothing strange. ⁶ Like draws to like.’ '⁹ There-
upon Ι could no longer hold my peace, but said, ‘⁶ Herr
Doctor, by your favour, ‹Iolccmn Pseufferleorn is an
honourable man; he is the trusty counsellor of his
Imperial Majesty, and he cometh of the tribe of iVaplz-
tali. That, be well assured, is a most ancient stock,
He might, an he would, boast himself to be of noble
birth—but doth not, for humility’s sake.’' Then said
the Doctor, “Take a spoon and bib your words!'⁷

once sought to saddle him with the shame of thest—
merely out of envy and execrable malice—whereupon
he cited them before the Imperial Chamber, and they
handed him thirty florins for costS, wherewith he was
content. ιῙοίιαηη chgfferkorn was indeed born of a
good stock, but when he was a Jew he did as other
Jews. For, as the proverb runs, ⁶ He who is among
wolves, must howl with the wolves.’ But now he
eateth swine’s flesh‚ and behaveth like a good Chris-
tian.” Then answered Doctor fllarner, ‘⁶ Doth Pfffssr-
