OST cordial and profound Herr Magister Orth'n .·
I, Jolzarm Selmarrlzoltz, ere long licentiate in
Theology in the University of Tilbz'ngen, greatly desire
to seek counsel of your worthinessz but Ι sear lest this
may savour of irreverence, seeing that you are of such
learning, and of such high repute in Cologne‚ that no
man dareth to draw near your worthiness without due
forethought—as it is written, “ Friend, how camest
thou in hither, not having a wedding garment ἲ ”

Nevertheless you are lowly-minded, and can bernean
yourself, as saith the Scripture, ‘⁶ VVhoso humbleth him-
self shall be exalted‚ and he that exalteth himself shall
be abased.’⁷ Therefore will I put off diffidence, and
confer boldly with your worthiness—yet so as with
reverence meet.

I lately heard a certain Magister of Paris deliver a
sermon here, before a great congregation on the Feast
of the Ascension. He took for his text, ‘⁶ God is gone
up with a shout''; and he preached a notable sermon,
so that all who heard lauded it, and, with tears, were
edified. The preacher in the second part of his dis-
course deduced two masterly and subtle inferences.
First, that when the Lord ascended on high with up-
lifted hands, then the apostles with the Blessed Virgin
stood and shouted until they were hoarse, that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, ‘⁶ I am
weary of crying, and my throat is dry.'’ He proved,
moreover, that this outcry was a shout of joy, and
furthermore necessary for the Catholic faith, as saith the
Lord in the Evangel, ‘⁶ Verily, verily I say unto you, if
these should hold their peace, the stones would cry out.’'
