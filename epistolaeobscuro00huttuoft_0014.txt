Few critics have disputed the substantia] justice of the
conclusion arrived at by Sir William Hamilton some
seventy-eight years ago: “Never,” he wrote, “were
unconscious barbarism, self-glorious ignorance, intol-
erant stupidity, and sanctimonious immorality, so
ludicrously delineated; never did delineation less be-
tray the artifice of ridicule. The Epistolae Obscuromm
Virormn are at once the most cruel and the most
natural of satireS.'' It is true that dissentient voices
may here and there be heard amidst the chorus of
applause, but one thing is certain: the historiali of
European literature—whether he deems the Epistola&
regarded as a piece of literary art, worthy of a pedestal
or not—cannot ignore them.

Nevertheless, the last edition of the Epistolae pub-
lished in England was that issued by Henry Clements
in 1742. This edition (which Ebert, for some unex-

such antiquated specimens of literar-y folly3 while
Steele, to whom, under his pseudonym of Isaac
Bickerstaff, the edition was dedicated, was, apparently,
completely deceived. ‘⁶ It seems,'' he wrote in The
Tatler (No. 197), “this is a collection of letters, which
some profound blockheads, who lived before our times,
have written in honour of each other, and for their
mutual information in each other’s absurdities. . . . It
is, methinks, wonderful that fellows could be awake,
and utter such incoherent conceptions, and converse
with great gravity like learned men, without the least
taste of knowledge or good sense.'' As the reading
public in those days was quite prepared to take Steele’s
word in such a matter, it is scarcely to be wondered at
that the Obscure Men were henceforth left almost un-
molested in their obscurity. In fact, as Mr. Saintsbury
