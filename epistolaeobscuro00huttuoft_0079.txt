found time, however, to write, among other poemS‚ a
noteworthy book of political epigrams which he dedi-
cated to Maximilian.

On his return to Germany, Hutten, now to be
ranked as an accomplished scholar, was honourably
received at the court of Albrecht, Archbishop of
Mainz‚ and here an important event in his life occurred,
his meeting, namely‚ with the already famous Erasmus,
to their mutual satisfaction.

The treacherous murder of Ulrich’s cousin Hans,
by the Duke of Wi‘irteniberg, in 1515, almost led to
a small war between the duke and the powerful clan
of the Huttens; Ulrich, who was expected by the
family “to do something‚'’ contributed to the fray

and a record of his journey thither assuredly exists in
the guise of Wilhelm Lamp's narrative in the Epis-

possibilities of its rapier thrusts as opposed to the
swashing blows of mere invective.

It was during this second sojourn of Hutten in
Italy that the first volume of the Epistolac appeared.
A copy was sent to him at Bologna, and in a letter
written thence (August 22, 1516) to Richard Croke
at Leipsic, he exclaims‚ “Accepi obscuros viros: dii
boni, quam non illiberales jocos 1²³ He goes on to say
that he is suspected of being the author, and asks his
friend to let him know more about the matter. Never-

the Epistolae contributions by his hand indisputably

sodality‚ Hutten had taken the keenest interest in the

Reuchlin controversy. As early as 1514 he had shown
