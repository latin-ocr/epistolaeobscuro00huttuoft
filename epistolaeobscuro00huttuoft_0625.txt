,Iohanni Psefferlvorn, Ι declared him to be over-jealous
if he acts thus, For there is a saying that friends have
all things in common—though some hold that wives are
to be excepted NevertheleSS, with thee he should not
be angry, seeing that you have no wife of your own,
, and we ought to give to those who have not. I hay 01
heard, moreov er, that you have lain with a maid· serv ant l

for the nonce.” And you said that sometimes in ten
whole days you would not make one good verse; for
Α the weather suffered it not, and you must needs wait
