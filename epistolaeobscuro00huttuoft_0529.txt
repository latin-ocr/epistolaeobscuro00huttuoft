[46] JOHANN WAGN ER V. AMBACH

That you may know who are the learned here, I
will speak first of the most worthy, and then of the
rest in turn, since, as the Philosopher saith in the First
Book of the I’lzgs.s·ic‚·.s·‚ “We must proceed from universals
to particulars. Pmplcz'rins too descends from the most
general genus to the most special specieS, where Plato
calls a halt. Moreover, appellation should be based on
the worthiest examples, as saith the heathen philosopher
in his Second Book of The Soul. Among all the
Doctors of Theology there is one here who is our
Preacher, and he hath a mighty voice, albeit he is a
little man. Folk hear his preaching right gladly, and

think much of him—for, pardy, he ls learned, nay,

Nominalists and Realists—and to the former he allotted
Satura, reasoning thus: ‘⁶ Sarum is a cold planet, and
he consorteth well with the moderns, for they are cold
Artsmen, who follow not after the way of St. Thomas,
and his Copulata and Reparcctz'ones according to the
syllabus of De Monte Hostel at Cologne.’' But to the
Thomists he allotted in the N ew Year the boy Gany-
mede who piggeth with Jupiter. Ganymede suiteth
well with the Realists, for he poureth out wine and beer
for Jove, and the sweet juice of liquorice—which story
Torrentius· hath fairly expounded in the F irst Book of
the AEnee'cl—-and in like manner do the Realists pour
forth their Arts and Science; and thereon he argued
much. And many other pleasant things said he,
