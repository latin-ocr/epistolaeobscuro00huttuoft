11 HERBORD MISTLADER offeretlz to filag-
ister Ortwin Gratius of learm‘ng incomparable,
leis own mos-t ‚sapient preceptor, salutations that
no man may number

LL-ENLIGHTENED Magister! &Vhen Ι parted
ss from your worthiness at Zwolla two years agone,
you plighted your troth that you would write oft to me,
and would provide for me in your writings patterns of
fair diction. But, alas, you have gone from your word,
and write not to tell me if you be quick or dead—and,
whether you be alive or dead, you tell me not which, or
what hath happed‚ or how the matter standeth. Dear
Lord 1 how you rack me! I beseech you, by the Lord
and St. George, free me from my solicitude3 for I am
in great dread lest you have a headache‚ or some infir-
mity in your boweIS, with a flux such as you once had
when you berayed your garments in the public street
and perceived it not until a woman cried out, ‘⁶ Herr
Magister! hast thou been sitting on a mixen? See!
even thy skirts and shoes are slubbered 1 ” And then
you turned in to Jolmnns Ifffcfferkornf's house, and his
wife gave you a change of raiment. It behoveth you
to eat hard-boiled eggS‚ and roasted chestnuts‚ and
cooked beans sprinkled with poppy-seed, as is the wont
in your country of lVestplzalz'a. I have dreamed a dream
concerning you—that you have a grievous cough and
much rheume witha13 eat therefore sugar—plums‚ and
peas mashed with thyme and pounded garlic; lay a
roasted onion on your navel, and be continent for six
days ; wrap up your head and your loins‚ and you will
be cured.

Or you may try the remedy that Jolzann Efeffer- ÷
ltorn’s wife hath often given to the infirm, and the virtue

whereof hath oft been proved.

From ZWOLLE.
