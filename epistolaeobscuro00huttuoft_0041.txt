IN TRODUGTION

humble capacity of a singing-man, Reuchlin found
himself by a sudden turn of fortune appointed bear-
leader to one of the Margrave's sons, and accompanied
his charge to Paris, where, under the tuition of the
eminent rector of the university, Johannes a Lapide
(von Steyn), he commenced the study of Greek. This
he continued at Basle‚ returning, however, to Paris in
1477, to sit at the feet of the famous George Hermony-
mus, who had recently arrived there. Jurisprudence
next claimed Reuchlin's attention, and with his ac-
customed ardour he devoted himself to its study at
Orleans and PoictierS.

Returning to Germany in 1481, Reuchlin soon

months had elapsed before the young scholar found

held the chair of Greek at Florence. Among scholars
even of this calibre Reuchlin held his own, and the
story goes that Argyropoulos, sorely piqued at the
young German’s mastery of Thucydides, exclaimed
testily‚ ‘⁶ Greece has flown over the Alps l ”

On his return to Germany honours and emoluments
fell thickly upon Reuchlin. Now Doctor of Civil Law,
he was appointed Procurator of the Dominican Order, -
and Assessor of the Supreme Court. To Eberhard he
was ever a trusted counsellor.

For ten years Reuehlin, now a married man, was
busily employed in affairs of state and in the per-
formance of various judicial duties, but in 1492 he paid
another visit to Italy, which lasted for a year and had
momentous consequences. Falling under the personal
influence of the dazzling but chaotic genius of Pico
della Mirandola——who contemplated humanism and
scholasticism with impartial eyes, and yearned for the
reconciliation of irreconcilable ideas—-the German
