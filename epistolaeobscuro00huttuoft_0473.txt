to wager my coat that if those verses contained any
faults you had not composed them, and that if you had
composed them they contained no faults. Accordingly
I send you the lines, that you may judge whether you
contrived them, or not, and let me know. The poem is
written concerning the death of Doctor Gerlmrd von
Zutplzen of Isneclc Hostel‚ who composed the commen-
tary but now, alas, is dead and gone. May he rest in
peace. Thus it beginneth :-—- >

A famous scholar here doth lie lamented‚

To th’ University by heaven presented3

He o’er Kneclc H ostel erst did Regent sit,

And pieced the Copulata bit by bit.

Oh! that he might upon the hither shore
Have lingered, and of comments written more ἱ
To adjuvate the University,

And teaeh her students fair Latinity!

But now, his life by death untimely lost,

With half the Alexander still unglossed‚

The University deplores her limb,

Who, like a shining lauteni, or the glim

Of candle in a candle-stick a-burning,

Lit far and wide the darkness with his learning.
What man than his could better periods round?
He joyed the upstart Poets to confound,

Who in their foolish grammars scorn reliance
On Logic—-of all Sciences the Science.

So, in the Faith being unillumined, they

From Mother Church aye wander, all astray.
But if to think aright they are not willing,
Soon will Hoogstraten set them all a-grilling!
Who Doctor Jolzann Reuclzlin lately cited,
Before the Court, and grievously indicted.
Almighty‚ to thy suppliant lend an ear,

Who humbly thee invokes‚ with many a tear,
To grant our member dead thy grace eternal‚
And pack the Poets off to realms infernal ἔ

This seemeth to me an excellent poem, though I know ζ’ i
not how to scan it, because it is of an unwonted kind,
and I have only skill to scan hexameters. Y ou must
suffer no man to spurn your verses3 so write to me,
and Ι will defend you even at the risk of single combat.
Fare ye well.
