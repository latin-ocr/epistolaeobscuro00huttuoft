1. 34] ORT WIN GRATIUS

Most amicable Herr Magister, you have unfolded
to me your amours, but Ι marvel that you are not too
prudent to hanker after maidens; I warn you that in
this you do ill, and that you have a sinful end in view,
that may bring you to hell—fire. Ι deemed you prudent,
and one that had no mind for such follies, for they ever
have an ill event.

Nevertheless Ι will give you the counsel that you
seek—as saith the Scriptum, “Ask ye, and ye shall
take.” First‚ you must cast aside those vain imagin-
ings concerning that Dlmgaret of yours, for they are
suggested to you by the Devil, who is the father of all
sin—as Riclzccrd allegeth, in his comment on the F ourth
Book. VVhensoever thoughts of her assail you, fail not
to cross yourself and say a paternoster, with that verse
of the Psalms, “The Devil stand at his right side.”
Neglect not to eat consecrated salt on the Lord⁷s Day,
and sprinkle yourself with holy water that the priest of
St. Rupert hath blessed. Thus may you escape from Ι,
that devil who hath instilled in you so great fervour for ’ξ
this Dlmgaret-who, after all, is not so comely as you ξ
think her; she hath a wart on her forehead, long red
shanks, and clumsy brown hands, and her breath ἕ
savoureth because of her foul teeth3 moreover she
hath a heavy stern, in accordance with the common
saying that “Ars BIcw‘gm-etoe is a wonderful·snare.’'
But you are so blinded by that devil-begotten passion
that you perceive not her faults. She cateth and
drinketh over much, and when she sat by me at table
she made a bounce and said it was the foot-stool. A
fairer wench than your Blargaret was mine at Cologne,
nevertheless Ι sent her packing. After she was wedded
she often used to send for me through an old crone— ,
yet I visited her but once, and then I was fuddled. I
counsel you to fast twice on the Sabbath, and after-
wards to make confession to a Doctor of the Order of
Preaelzers, who will set you on your legs again. And
when you have made confession you must pray to St.
Cleristoplzer to bear you on his shoulders‚ that you
backslide not, nor be soused in that great and wide
sea wherein are creeping things innumerable—that is,
numberless sins, as saith the Combihilator-and, finally,
