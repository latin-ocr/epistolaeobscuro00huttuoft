1. 9] CONRAD OF ZWICKAU

always sick. He is for ever chiding me, and telling me
that Ι ought not to set my affections on women, for that
they are devils, and bring men to destruction, and are
abominable, and that no woman is chaste‚ and that to
consort with a woman is as bad as consorting with a,
devil, and that they allow a man no peace. Then said ξ
Ι, “Cry you mercy, Herr Magister, but your mother{
was a woman !’⁷ And with that I left him. ἱ

He hath been preaching too, of late‚that priests should
in no wise maintain concubines, and he declared that
bishops are guilty of mortal sin when they take milk-
tithes, and wink at priests consorting with their hand-
maidens, whereas they ought to drive them forth one
and all.

Be this as it may, we must sometimes be merry and
have to do with a wench, when nobody is the wiser3

wherefore we hope for forgiveness,

Herewith Ι send you a certain writing in defence of
Aleoeander Gallus—that grammarian time-honoured and
trusty, notwithstanding that the “ Poets ” of to-day scoff
at him : but they know not what they say, for Alexander
is the best of all, as you were wont to tell me when we
were at Deventer. A certain Magister here gave me the
tractate, but I wot not where he obtained it. would
that you might have it printed, and then would you
make the ‘⁶ Poets ” rage furiously‚ for the author trounces
them roundly. And it is so poetically composed that it
passeth Σ He that wrote it was a pretty poet and Theo-
loger withal, and he holdeth not with the secular poets
—such as Doctor Reuelelz'n, Eusebius, and the rest.

No sooner had that document been put into my
hands than I promised myself to send it to you, that you
might read it. If you have any news give me know-
ledge of it. Farewell, in love unfeigned.
