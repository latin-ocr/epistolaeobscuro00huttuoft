LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Love,” that lovers ought to be as bold as warriors‚ else it
availed them not?

Then said Ι to her, ‘⁶ Reverend mistress mine, for-
give me for God’s love, and for your honour's sake—but
Ι love you, and I have ehosen you from among all the
children of men3 for you are fair among women, and
there is no spot in you. You are the goodliest that
there is in the whole world.” Then she laughed, and
said, ‘⁵ Pardy! you talk full loverly—if Ι could but
trust you l ‘⁹ And after that Ι often visited her at her
house, and drank with her. And when I was in the
chureh Ι always stood where I could see her, and in
turn she looked me through and through. At last I
earnestly asked her to keep me in her thoughts—where-
upon she deelared that Ι loved her not. But Ι swore
that Ι loved her as my own mother, and that Ι would
dare all things in her service, though it should eost me
my life. Then answered the lady fair: ‘⁶ I would fain
learn if that be so,” and she made a oross with ohalk

upon the door of her house, and said: ‘⁶ If you love me,
Ξ you will kiss that eross, for my sake, every evening
'j after dark.’⁷ This Ι did for many days, but at last came
ξ some one and smeared the oross with filth, and when Ι
ἓ kissed it I defiled my lips and teeth and nose. Then
,³ was Ι full of wrath against the lady; but she swore by
Ι the Holy of Holies that she had no hand in the matter.
And Ι believe her, for she is in all else an honourable
woman.

I have suspicion of a student here, that the deed was
his. Can I but bring it home to him—verily Ι say unto
you, he shall have his reward! But she useth me in
more friendly wise than formerly, and 1 trust I shall yet
gain her favours. She heard of late that I was a poet.
Then quoth she: ‘⁶ Ι have been told that you are a jolly
rhymer—so you must write me a ballad 1²⁷ This Ι did,
and I sang it in the street at even-tide that she might
hear3 and afterwards I rendered it for her into German.
It runneth thus :—-

Venus benign 3 of love the fountain and the queen ἔ
Why frownest thou on me with such a hostile mien?
Oh, Dorotleea mine! whom I sor mistress choose,
Me for thy leman true, in turn, do not refuse!
