a sinecure benefice that would suit me best of all.

Now Ι must tell you in the next place, Herr Orth'n,
that I could not get back immediately to Rome by
reason of the war in Italy: naked scoundrels were
running about in every direction; and if one of them
had taken my clothes, then should Ι have lost all my
poverty, 35 the old woman said when she broke her
eggs on Heilbronn bridge. So it came to pass that

which you once showed me in a little book written

But to proceed; they once asked me over the wine
—seeing that Ι was from the Curia—how matters stood
in the Cause of the Faith between Joleamz Reuclzlin
and the Colognese. Quoth I, “I fear me gleatly that
Jolzamz Reuclzlzn, good man, is too poor to bring the
case to an end. The Preachers can go further with
their sacks of cheese than a lone man with his money.”
