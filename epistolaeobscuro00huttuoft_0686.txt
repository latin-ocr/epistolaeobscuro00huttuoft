XALTED Master of Arts good and evil; may it

please your worship to know that I will now fulffl
the promise that I promised at your instance, when
I departed from Cologne-namely‚ that Ι would fail
not to send you all the news

Before all things you were desirous that Ι should
notify you concerning that crafty J urlst Jolmnn
Remlzlm, with whom Doctor Jakoh zan Hoogstmten
hath sharp contention concerning the Faith at the
Roman Court. All these matters will Ι unfold, out of
the love that Ι bear you.

In the first place, then—to relate all things from
the foundation of the world—you must know that
having set out for Rome in the dog-days, as you will
remember, I met with no great misadventure on the
way, save exceeding great thirst when Ι traversed the
lofty mountains of Allgc‘lu with my comrades.

When Ι reached Rome I engaged myself as varlet
to a CardinaL hard by the Campo dei Flore] him Ι
served with great diligence for eight months, to gain
a cure of souls at Iselbertzlzausen in the diocese
of V ollenberg. Now, with this object, Ι obtained a
brief with the seals of twelve Cardinals, and his Holi-
ness prefixed his own seal for the firmer security.
Thereupon with great joy Ι set forth to take possession
-when‚ lo! the Incumbent was not dead aster all!
Then cried I in great wrath, “A thousand devils fly
away with him! Am Ι to lose my money?” ’Twas
a mighty poor prebend, too. An Ι had known this,
Ι would never have left Rome. Ι reckoned that it
might bring me in good twenty gulden every year
You well know that Ι should not think of residing m
such a place I would far rather have a prebend near
home at Deventew of a hundred gulden, with a simple
handmaid of twelve‚ than one of thirty gulden up
