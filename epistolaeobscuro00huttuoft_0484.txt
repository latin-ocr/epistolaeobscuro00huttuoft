LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

a discreet and upright man should make no promise that
he doth not keep. It would be the height of fickleness
in me not to keep my promises to you, and Ι should be
a deceiver.

You must write back to me, and then we will often
send, or address, letters in turn to each other.

Now you must know that Doctor Reuclzlin hath pub-

something out at elbows. You ask me how Ι thrive in
general. I thank you for asking‚ and you must know that,
by God’s grace, I am doing well. At the last vintage I
pressed much wine, and of crops I have an abundance.

By way of news I may tell you that our most serene
Lord, the Emperor, is sending a great force into Lom-
