11. 33] PETER LAPP

Germany possessed such 'sheologians3'' but another
averred that he was not well versed in the language of
the Bible‚ and understood not Jerome and Augustz'ne.
Then said Ι, “Ο guter Gottl what sayest thou?
The Doctor taketh such things for granted3 he himself
hath other things to attend to, and much more subtle
matters.”

, May the Lord grant that all turn out well; then
{eometh our triumph; we will drive out Poetry from
J the whole of Germany, and we will bring it about that
{the Jurists shall not dare to utter a word when they
{are in the presence of Theologians3 for they shall
{sear lest the Inquisitor be set upon them, and they be
}burned for heretics—as Ι hope will yet happen to
{Johann Reuclzlin, by God's aid, whose judges we are:
{for as soldiers defend Justice upon Earth, so do we
{defend the Church by our disputations and sermons.
''Pardon my verbosity. Farewell.

Hoogstraten, Magister-nosters Arnold von Tongern,
Remigius, and Valentia von Gelterslzeim, Magister-
noster Peter, who in my time presided over Ism‘elc
Hostel, Herr Roger the Licentiate, and many others
now dwelling in Cologne ,· Joleann Pfqfferlcorn too, who,
although he is a layman, and unlearned in the Liberal
Arts, and hath never attended Christian schools nor
learnt Grammar or Logic, nevertheless hath, as you
say, a profound intelleet and an enlightened heart.

(Even the Apostles were not men of learning, and
