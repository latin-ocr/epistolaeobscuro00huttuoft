Among the members of Mutian’s Circle‚ as it began
to be called, was one to whom we have as yet made no
reference. This was J ohann Jager, afterwards known to
the world of letters as Crotus Rubianus (or, Rubeanus).
This remarkable inan was born at Dornheim, in 1480.
He was of humble origin, and as a boy tended his
father's ¹goats in the rugged Thi'lringerwald. In his
eighteenth year, however, he matriculated at Erfurt,
and graduated bachelor in 1500. His Latinised name
at first was, naturally, ,loannes Venatoris, and “ Crotus
Rubianus ³* is decidedly enigmatical, until we remember
that Dornheiin is “tllorn—home,” and we are further
given as a clue the fact that “Crotos’' appears in the
De He Ru.s·ti‹·a¹ of Columella as a synonym of Sagit-
tarius. A far-fctched cognomen was in those days an
indication of sound scholarship.

Crotus was at first wholly orthodox, and he was the
warm friend of another orthodox young student—Martin
Luther——all too soon to quit the university for an
Augustinian convent. That Crotus, however, had
early doubts of the advantages of a monastic life is
evidenced by his helping young Ulrich von Hutten,
then a boy of seventeen, to escape from the abbey of
Fulda, where he was iminured.

Crotus’s orthodoxy was, however, in those days, of
by no means robust growth, and by 1509 he had
become one of the leading lights among the Erfurt
humanists, and conspicuous for his nimble wit and
biting jests. ‘⁶ Omnia ridensj' it was said of him, ‘⁶ sed
seriis pariter aptus.'' His gaiety and common sense
were alike conspicuous.

For a year or two Crotus had supported himself by
the tuition of a few ‘⁶ sprigs of nobility,'’ on Mutiau's re-
commendation, but in 1509 one of those lovers' quarrels
leading to a renewal of love—it was not the first—-took
placc between the University and the municipality of
Erfurt. So sharp was this town and gown squabble
that many of the latter sought peace in flight, among
them being nearly all the niclnbers of the Mutianic
