PREFACE

sents itself at every turn. Into such alluring pleas-
ances the leisured reader will find his own way.

A text that contains intentional blunders, and in
which the grammar is a law to itself, seems to call for
exceptional treatment.

It is the Editor’s opinion that emendations in such
a case should be resorted to very sparingly, if at all.

The text of the First Edition of each of the suc-
cessively issued portions of the Epistolae has, accord-
ingly, been in all essentials closely adhered to. The
precise reproduction of error, except by mechanical
facsimile, involves, however, difficulties of its own,
and in a few instances unwelcome “ accuracies” may
perhaps have passed unnoticed.

The numerous typographical ligatures have, as a
rule, been resolved, except when ambiguous or distinc-
tive of an edition3 but mere abbreviations, such as
Sal. for Salutem, or M. for Blagisser, have been retained.

Eccentricities in the use of capitals and in punctua-
tion have been preserved, but, as a concession to the
modern reader, quotation marks are introduced, and
each period begins with a capital letter.

VVhere e, with or without a subscript, stands in the
original text for ae, the latter is everywhere employed.
The usage of the early editions in this respect seems
determined merely by caprice of the printers, or imper-
fections of the type.

Variant readings in the early editions, that seem at
all worthy of note, are given in Appendix Ι.
