save ‘⁶ Arguitur‚” “ Respondetur‚” and ‘⁴ Quaeritur‚'' and
having for their Gods Tartaretus, and Versor, and Per-
versor, and Buridan and Bruxellensis and the like, differ
not from the vulgar herd.

N evertheless it is a strange thing for a mere student
—a greenhorn——to know more of Aristotle than a can-
didate for a Bachelor’s or Master's degree, who hath
attended the courses‚ and is fully qualified. Moreover
they are not respectful to the Magisters, and when they
meet one they fail to touch their caps, as would be
seemly, and they are perpetually to be found at that
house you well wot of. Moreover they never listen to
the “ Consequentias ” of stlarsz'lius, nor the ‘⁶ Supposi-
tiones‚” nor the ‘⁶ Parva Logicalia ” ; 30 that it is not pos-
sible that they should be duly trained to take part in
disputations. But let this pass. Ι 1111131 now tell you
some news: Jacob IVimplzelz‘ng, who is half a Reueh-
linist, hath been roundly taken to task by a certain
Monk‚ Paul Lang by name, who hath told him plainly
that he hath not written the truth in a book of his
intituled “De Integritate’'——to wit, in saying that
learning is not only to be found beneath a cowl. For
Paul the Monk wrote another book to refute this, which
was approved by the Chapter, or Synod, of the Order
of St. Benedict at Reinlzarcltsbronn, in the year of our
Lord 1509. It is fine Latin, withal—-almost as good as
Alexander’s Doctrinale, it hath been said3 and Ι re-
joice greatly that such Latin is to be found among
monks. They say themselves that it superlatively ex-
celleth the style of Cicero—but this Ι scarcely believe,
for that striketh a high note. Nevertheless it argueth
learnedly against lVimplzeling in verse, and in prose,
and in rime3 and it holdeth, rightly as Ι think, that all
learning lieth under a cowl—that is, with the monks.
For, to proceed from things small to great, the monks
haye written commentaries on grammatical rules, on
Donatus, on Pete? of Spain, upon the Physics and the
Metaphysics and the Ethics, and haxe thus submerged
them in 111611 comments, and haxe become masters of
all knowledge.

Yet, by your faxv our, Ι would fain distinguish. F 1rst‚
with regard to the word ‘⁶ cowled,’' for that is an equi-
