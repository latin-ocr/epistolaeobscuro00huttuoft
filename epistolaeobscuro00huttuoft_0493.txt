1. 29] TILMANN LUMPLIN

Pyramus signifieth the Son of God, and Thisbe, the
soul of man, which Christ loveth, and concerning which
it is written in the Gospel, “A sword shall pierce
through thy own soul also.’' And in like manner
Thisbe slew herself with her lover’s sword.

Concerning V ulcan, who was thrown down from
heaven and was made lame, it is written in the Psalms:
‘⁶ They were cast down and could not stand.''

All this, and much more, I have learnt out of that
book. If you were but with me you should behold
marvellous things.

P And this is the way in which we ought to study ξι
oetry.

Nevertheless you will forgive me if I seem, as it
were, to be instructing your worthiness (for your learn-
ing is greater than mine), but it is in good saith that 1
have written.

I have arranged that one of the folk at Tilbz'ngen
should keep me informed of Doctor Reuclclz'n’s doings‚
so that I might warn you. But I have learnt nothing,
or 1 would let you know.

And now, farewell, in love unfeigned.

‘⁶ AM more brutish than any man, and have no

understanding3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have
the knowledge of the holy’' (Prov. mmm). Yet scorn
me not if Ι make bold to give you counsel in your
affairs, for I do this with good intent. I desire, more-
over, to monish you according to my knowledge, and
modestly to chide you, for ‘⁶ vexation giveth under-
standing.’' Now it is written in the ledom of the
Son of Sircwlz, ‘⁶ He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled
therewith.’⁷ And thus it falleth out in your case, since
you are fain to have me for a friend3 wherefore you
must take my chastenings in good part.
