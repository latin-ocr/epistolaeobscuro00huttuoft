11. 62] MAGISTER GRATIUS

doth not shine quite so brightly, to wit, Herr Jolecmm
Psissfferkrorn.

And l verily believe that if you four, with all your
knowledge, were bound together to a stout stake, in an
exalted position, on a pile of dry wood‚ there might
straightway be kindled a light of the world, bri ghter
even than that which blazed at Reme. But, degarest
nephew‚ all this is naught save a merry jest of mine,
and—quips apait—l hope you four will become a true
light of the world· it is impossible that such learning
as yours can long rremain sunk in the mire.

It hath come oto my ears that not long ago you would
fain have bussed, aftei dark, an old trot who selleth
pots hard by the fountain at Cologrze, but she lifted up
her voice, and folk came around the house with lanterns,
and discovered you. Pardy! I highly esteem such fine
pranks of yours, for they smell of my art, which pointeth
too in some sort at Theologians also,

There hath of late been a rumour here that a poet
hath appeared in Cologne. He alone holdeth you for a
fool, and calleth you Porsz'nus—that is, meet dweller
in a pig-Sty. Pardy! if I could only serape acquaint-
ance with that same poet, right gladly would I hang
him without fee Ξ

And now, in conclusion, beloved nephew, Ι would
earnestly beseech you to strive with great diligence to
spiead your lenown throughout the whole earth, were
it not that Ι well know such counsel to be needless
For this you well know of yourself‚ and have received
it from your giandparents—ay, and f1 om your great· and
great· great· and great· g1·-0eat-o·reat- -grand- pai ents and
especially fiom your mothel, my deaily- belov ed siste1‚
who had no sooner heard that bastards are evei more
the favourites of fortune than the true—born, than she
straightway betook herself to a priest‚ and let him work
his will, that there might be begotten such a man as
you, whom some day all the world shall hear of!
Farewell.

From HALBERSTADT.
