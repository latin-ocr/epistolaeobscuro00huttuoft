LETTERS OF OBSCURE MEN

Ι have perceived‚ or understood, that you hold your
peace in the matter of Jolzmm Reuehhn, and make no
rejoinder to his attacks. Therefore I have great wrath,
for Ι love you, and it is written, “Whom Ι love, I
chasten.” Wherefore did you begin to retort to him iq
you meant not to persevere ἲ Are you not man enough}
for him? By the Lord you are, and especially do you}
excel him in Theology‚ wherefore you should reply to}
him, and defend your reputation, and preach the Chris-{1
tian Faith‚ against which that heretic writeth. You²{
should have respect unto no man, as saith Solomon in ᾖ,
Ecclus. oezzz'. ἦ

Fear not the power of the Jurists-——lest they should
do you carnal hurt--for you must suffer such things
for the saith and the truth. As saith Christ, in St.
Blattlzew’s Gospel, “ If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove
hence, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be im-
possible unto you.’⁷ But it is impossible for Doctor
Rem-Idm to write what is true, for he hath not wholly
kept the saith, since he defendeth the Jews, who are
foes of the faith ; and he holdeth not with the opinions
of the Doctors ; moreover he is a sinner, as Dr. Jolcann
Ifffefferlsorn setteth forth in his book entitled “ lee
Tocsz'n.’' Now sinners should not meddle with Holy
Writ‚ as it is written in the oelioetla Psalm, “ But
unto the wicked God saith, W hat hast thou to do to
declare my statuteS, or that thou shouldest take my
covenant in thy mouth?'’ Wherefore Ι exhort you,
and Ι beseech you from my very midriff, to boldly defend
yourself, that men may say, to your praise, that you
have been a bulwark to the Church and to your own
good name. Have respect unto no man—even though
the Pope should inhibit you—for the Church is above
the Po e.

Ι Ριξγ thee have me excused for counselling you, for
I love thee—lord‚ thou knowest that Ι love thee.

Fare thee well, in all stoutness of body and of soul.
