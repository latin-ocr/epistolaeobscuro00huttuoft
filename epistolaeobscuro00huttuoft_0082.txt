INTRODUCTION

Busche. The general tenor of this scholar’s writings
is satirical-—oftcn bitterly so-—and Ortwin Gratius,
his former schoolfellow, had become his pet aversion.
Buschius was 111016016111 keen Reuchlinist when the
Epistola( were published‚ and was an intimate fliend
of both Hutten and Crotus. It is on such grounds as
these, towether with certain verbal 001110111611065, that
H amilton would allow to Buschius a larger share ln the
work than now seems probable.

A final problem confronts us—-that is the actual
position of the Epistola& among the factors that pro-
duced the ecclesiastical cataclysm known as the Refor-
mation 2 VVere they a factor in any sense ἶ( VVere they
a cause or an effect? Even with reference to the
Reuchlin controversy, are they to be compared to the
brilliant cavalry charge that wins the battle, or to a
mere paean of victory when all is over?

To these questions very diverse answers have been
forthcoming—and will be forthcoming, until that dis-
tant day when the distorting prejudices„ the antipatliies‚
the lmtreds, arouscd by religious controversy become as
fleeting as the healing antagonisms of war.

necessary to inquire whether any of the works mentioned
effected aught for the countries of their origin beyond
conferring undying fame upon their literature. Hadi-

prostrate foe; as sor the Knight of La Mancha, a recent
critic has pointed out that not until a century and a
