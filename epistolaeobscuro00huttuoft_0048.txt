expressed doubts as to Pfefferkorn's literary com-
petence, and had gone far to “asperse his parts of
speech!” It was easy for the fiery pervert to instil
in his Dominican patrons the like noble rage. Should
a mere jurist, forsooth, be permitted to show inde-

Theology were in no doubt? “Holy Maryl⁷⁷ cries
Pastor Peter Meyer, “a child knows more theology

upon the ecclesiastical mind that other than doctrinal

In due time a counterblast was forthcoming. In

was otherwise lacking—means of obtaining widespread

to Maximilian elicited kindly assurances from the
emperor, but nothing more. The autumn fair at
Frankfort was drawing near, and unless Reuchlin took
