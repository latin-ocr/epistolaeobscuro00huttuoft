answer, “Bf'eff'erlrorn of a truth compiled the work,
but lNIagister Ortwin afterwards Latinised it.'' Said
the priest, “l know well enough that Ortwin com-
posed the Latin, for Ι recognised his style at once.
I know too that Ortwin is of a good stock—a priestly
one, to wit. But tell me one thing: you must confess
that Pfqfferlcorn knoweth not the Latin alphabet‚ much
less can he read. And if he cannot read, much less
can he understand. And if he cannot understand,
much less can he write and eompose. And if he ean
neither read, nor understand, nor write—much less
can he diseuss questions that none but a deeply
learned man can deal with. Tloerefore, how is it
possible that he put together that material, either in
Latin, or German, or Hebrew?’' I replied that I
supposed that Ifffqfferlsorn had such an enlightened
inteflect, and had heard so much of the subject-

pronounce benediction, and do such things that if a
layman who had always been a Christian were to do
them, nevertheless we should have no good opinion of
him—much less is it seemly in the ease of a baptized
Jew, who cannot be shewn to be a true Christian until
he be dead. And such things as this ought not to
be suffered, much less should he be permitted to thrust
himself into the disputations of learned men and thus be
an offence to all honest folk. He ought to be hanged—
with his books and his scandals——as he hath long
deserved.”
Ι made answer that his preaching was not pontifical,
