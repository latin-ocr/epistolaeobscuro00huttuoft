LETTERS OF OBSCURE ΜΕΝ

same cheese-colleeting monks! Not long ago Brother
N„ 01 1116 monastery here, came to my cottage, and
would fain have forced my sister. He pursued her
up the steps into the house. and threw her down, and
would have worked his will, but my sister cried ⁶ Herr
N.! Herr N.! desist‚ 01 Ι will scream that all the
world shall hear, and then will the Devil shend you.’
‘Body o' mel⁷ cried he, ‘Cry not 0111, 1111(1 Ι will
give you handsel, 11 11 6051 1116 111111 a guldenl' Then
6111116 1161· 111011161, and 116 5111116(1. (His foiled fury!
dangerous as a harrow-tine under a eloiltl).⁷' Then
said another who sat near, ‘⁶ If the 6011100 had treated
my sister thus, I would have stoned him, and 56111 1116
011161 monks piekled cod for feast—day.’' Then replied
the other: “Pardyl I 61111 forgive 1116111, for they are
ever eloistered. I trow an ass with a kirtle on would
scaree find security—how then a wenchW’ Another
straightway sware that Jolmmz Rendelin was minded
to put down in a book all 1116 evil deeds 01 1116 monks
throughout (r'ermcmys. This he will present to his
Holiness with 111656 words: “therefore doth not
Hoogstraten 61151 0111 11115 11661111011511655 110111 among
1115 brethre11?” The fellow would have it, too, that
monks savour like sweating 116-901115, and that in his
country they have tainted all the 1111115, 50 111111 upon
occasion he might believe a cowl was at hand, by reason
of that odour 01 sanetity.

Now you, Magister Ortwin. are their fautor: Take
heed lest, to mend matters, there be added to the
Inquisitor 01 1161611601 I'ravity, an Inquisitor 01 Libi-
dinous Depravity. Let them at all events work their
iniquities privily in their cells, like their 11611615, where
none can see: all might then go well, but open vice
15 11 5611011111 10 1116 whole Order. Beware lest evil come
upon you.

After all, 1 1111116 again betaken lnyself to the Court‚
and await Heaycn's favour. 1⁴'arewell.
