11. ιε] WILHELM LAMP

rejoice to hear that you are quite well too. Ι hope that,
please God, you are in good case.

Now you must know how that as soon as I arrived at
the ‘⁶ Crown” at sslainz, Ι found certain folk there who
were talking about the Cause of the F aith, and were of
Doct01·11'evclelin'.5· part3 and when they saw me to be
of Cokgne, they but talked the more, and treated me with
disdain. They praised Johamz Reuclzlz'n, and disparaged
the Magisternosters at Cologne, and called them bats that
could do nothing in the light of day, but flew by night
and busied themselves in the darkness. Then quoth Ι,
“ Hear the other side ἱ ” and Ι quoted to them the “Flores

there were many Doctors, assessors at the Supreme
Court. They said dreadful things about the Theo-

Pseffkrlforn on account of the “ Tocsin.” One of them
said, ‘⁶ Mark my words; in a few years these Magister-
nosters will be swept away, and will be heard of no
more.” Then said Ι, “ ἎἿιο then will preach to you,
and instruct you in the Catholic faitl12” He replied,
