(I MA GJSTER CORNELIUS STORA TI
sendetlc abundant greetings to Blage'ster Orth'n

ONFORMABLY to the request which you sent
me when l was at Rome, that I should let you
know to a tittle how matters stood in the Cause of
the Faith between you and the other Theologians,
on the one hand, and Johmm Reuclalin on the other

two or three horses, and gold in the bank, and when
he kept open house, then the courtiers rendered him

and the answer would come, “He is a Doctor from
Germany, none is more renowned: he is a philosopher,
and so excelleth in disputations that he hath no peer.
He is here to maintain the Cause of the Faith against
some secular Jurist.” Then would the courtiers sing
his praises, and many a time has one said to me,
‘⁶ Herr Cornelius, commend me to this renowned
Doctor!'' Then his patrons abounded and his cause
flourished. But now you desert him, and stint his
supplies. Not long ago I was in his chamber‚ and
casting my eyes on his mantle that lay there, I saw
that it was full of vermin. And he, observing that
l saw this, cited the Scripture which saith, “Thy
congregation shall dwell therein, for thou, O God,
