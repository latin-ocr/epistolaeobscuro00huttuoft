convivial, and if a man be but mellow once in a day,
they take it amiss, and 6311 him a swine. There is no

extortionate, and uneomely withal. I tell you of a
truth that in Italy the women are as ill-made as is
possible, notwithstanding their fine gowns of silks and
velvets. For when they are 363166 middle-aged they
all grow orook-backed‚ and walk about as if they had
the gripes. They eat garlio, moreover, and savour
rankly. They are swarthy‚ too, and not fair like
German lasses. Their cheeks are pallid as death—and
though some be blowsy, it is plain that they have
ruddled themselves with salves, VVherefore the women
of Rome please me not. They have a saying that it is
not physieal to go a-wenching here in the dog-days.

for he is 3 very subtle man, and given to speaking mysti-
eally by tropes. But a friend of yours, as Ι have heard
ᾗ 1611, expounded these riddling words, and interpreted
them thus: “Would that you would eat from your
own plate ''—that is, lie with your own wife or mistress
—“and let me eat from mine ’'——that is, lay not your
hands on my wife, but leave her to me.

I asked· a certain poet, 1161·6,10 seek out this aphorism
in the Adages of Ε7 (laneus,- but he told me that he could
