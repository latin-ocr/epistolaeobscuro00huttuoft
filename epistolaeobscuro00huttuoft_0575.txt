doubtless, he doth not, but the Theologians of Paris have
instructed him, and his Confessor Guillmame Petit, a
very zealous man, hath told him, in confession, that he
will not shrive him, unless he bring it about, through
the Pope, that Reuelzlin shall be declared a heretic.”
Then I rejoiced greatly, and cried, “May the Lord
grant that it shall be according to your words ! ’' Ι met
many courtiers there who were known to me, and I
invited them to the Inn. ,

Thence we proceeded to Floreuoe, which is as fair
a city as any upon earth.

Afterwards we came to δ’ἱεηηα, where there is a
Universsty, but the Theologians are few. Then we
came to sundry small towns. One of these is called
Illontcficzseone. There we drank of the best wine that Ι
had ever tasted in my life, and I asked the taverner
how it was named. ‘⁶ Lacrima Christi,” said he. Then
said my companion, ‘⁶ Would that Christ shed tears in
the F atherland l '’ And there we had a roaring bowse.

Three days later we reached Rome. The Lord be
praised, who hath delivered us from so many dangers
by the way—not to speak of botched shoeS. I have as yet
heard no news at Court, except that I have seen a
beast as big as four horses, and which hath a snout as
long as Ι, and is a wondrous creature. then I saw it,
I said, “ God is wonderful in his works.” I would give
a florin for you to see that beast. And now, pardy, I
trow Ι have acquitted myself well in writing. Do the

like, d‹IJr I will never write to you again. Farewell
soun y.

From R0ME3 in haste.

I censure you, seeing that I do it with all good will.
Lately, in a tractate, you described a certain theo-
