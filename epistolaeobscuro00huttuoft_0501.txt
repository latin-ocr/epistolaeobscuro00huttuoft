1. 33] MAMMOTRECT BUNTEMANTEL

we drank and were merry, she too pledged you in great
bumpers.

Her Ι love with such passion that Ι am beside myself.
Believe me, because of her I can neither eat nor sleep.
Folk say to me, “Herr Magister, why so pale? For
the love of God quit your books; you study over much;
you should now and again seek some diversion‚ and
drink deep; you are yet in your youth, and are well
able to proceed Doctor and become Magister Noster.
You are a profound and able scholar, and are almost
the equal of a Doctor.”

But Ι am bashful, and cannot unfold my disorder. ,

that Ι believe she loveth me—seci'etly. Her glance, in
sooth, wounded my heart as though an arrow had
pierced it, and straightway Ι went home with my
servant, and flung myself upon my bed.

Then my mother fell a-weeping, because she thought
Ι was sick of the plague, and she ran with my water to
Dr. Brunca, crying out, ‘⁶ Herr Doctor, Ι beseech you
by the Lord to heal my son; I will give you a fine
shirt for a see, because I made a vow that he should
become a priest ! ” Then the leech cast the water, and
