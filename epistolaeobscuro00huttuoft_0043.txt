by the learned, while the Elector Philip, at once recog-
nising his worth, made him a member of his council‚
and sent him on a diplomatic mission to Rome. This
gave Reuchlin an opportunity of making further pro-
gress in his favourite study under the guidance of
Qbadyah Sforno of Cesena. On his return from Italy
Reuchlin* betook himself once more to Stuttgart, where
the third duke, Ulrich, was still a minor, and in 1502
he attained his highest judicial rank as a Judge of the
Swabian League.

The year 1506 saw the publication of Reuchlin⁷s
De Badium-ntis Hebraicis, an elementary Hebrew
grammar—largely derived from a work by the rabbi,
David Kimchi, quoted by Boswell—-but displaying
wide reading, and destined to have a powerful effect in
attracting the attention of scholars to Semitic studies.

The necessary limitations of this Introduction do
not permit of reference to Reuchlin's many other
literary labours in the field of pure scholarship. If we
have succeeded in suggesting the outline of his interest-
ing personality, it must suffice. Geiger's admirable
‘⁶ Life,'' unfortunately, still awaits a translator.l

Somewhat close intercourse with learned Jews of
the best type naturally aroused in Reuchlin’s heart a
kindly interest in the scattered and persecuted people
whose sacred, philosophical‚ and mystic literature he
had now grappled with for ten years, and towards the

send of 1505 he was led to publish, at Pforzheim, a
pamphlet of ten pages, entitled, Doctor Iolzamzs Reueh-

long and miserable exile, attributes it to their obstinate
denial of Christ, and ends by inviting any Israelite in
search of instruction in the tenets of the true faith to
come to him, not merely as a catechumen but as a
guest. It is whispered that even at the present day
creature comforts, as aids to saith, are not wholly
neglected, but if the learned and hospitable doctor
