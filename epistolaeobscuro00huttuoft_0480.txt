NASMIJCH as you were once my pupil at Dcventem

where I loved you before all my scholars. in that
you were a youth of good parts and very towardly, Ι
therefore am ever mindful to give you good eounsel
whensoever it lieth in my power.

But you must take it in good part, for God who
seeeth the heart knoweth that I speak but for love of
you, and for the Saving of your soul.

There were here of late certain fossz, hailing from
Cologne, and they deelared that there is a woman in that
eity who is oft at your house. and that you are oft at hers,
and have commeree with her. Now when I heard these
sayings Ι was smitten with great dread. for if this be
true‚it is a grievous seandal,seei11g that you are a graduate
and will in due time rise to higher things, to wit, a degree
in sacred Theology. Moreover. when Such doings of
yours are noised abroad, a bad example is set to the
young, who are thereby corrupted. You know how that
the son of Siraelz saith z “ For many have perished by the
beauty of a woman: for hereby lust is enkindled as a
111’6;” 'I'lee I’reaelter, too, toueheth the matter: ⁶· Turn
away thy face from a woman dressed up, and look not
upon another's beauty ; '⁷ and again ε “ Gaze not upon a
maiden. lest her beauty be a stumbling-bloek to thee.''
Full well you know that incontinenee is a grievous sin.
M oreover, what is worse, I hear that this woman liveth
in lawful wedloek with her husband. For the Lord's
sake send her paekhrg, and have regard to your own
good name. It is a disgraee that men should say of a
theologian that he is an avoutererz and yet in other
matters your repute is fair enough. and all deem you a
competent scholar—as Ι well know you to be. Once
every day you must devoutly eall to remembranee the
Lord’s Passion, for that is a powerful remedy against
