LETTERS OF OBSCURE ΜΕΝ

Rome with three horses, and now he goeth afoot.’'
Then said l to him, ‘⁶ W ould you fain have my horse 2 ''
And he answered, riming :——-

“‘ Willest thou have ? ' he need not say
who fain would freely give away.'’

Then said I, “Pardy! Excellent Sir, there is a
vacant benefice awaiting me, and Ι must needs make
haste—else would Ι yield thee my steed,” and there-
