poets! For they say that the Artsmen decoy youthS,
and take their money, and make Baehelors and Doctors
of them though they know nothing. And they have
brought it about that students no longer desire to gradu-
ate even in Arts‚ but all wish to became Poets. I have
a friend who is a worthy youth, and talented withal,
and his parents sent him to I ngoLs‘tadt, and I gave him a
letter of introduction to a Magister there who is duly
qualified in Arts and intendeth to graduate Doctor
of Divinity—but the youngster must needs quit the
Magister and attend the lectures of Plzilomusus the poet.
Of a truth Ι am woundily grieved for that young man,
as it is written, Prot). mim„ “He that hath pity upon
the poor lendeth unto the Lord”; for if he had but
stayed with the Magister he would have been Baehelor
by this time. And now his labour is in vain—if he
were to study Poetry for ten years.

lpraises of the Saints. Most earnestly do I desire to
know how that affair of Doctor Reuclzlin's standeth. If
I ean be of any service to you therein prithee let me
know, and tell me all things eoncerning it. Farewell.

urgently‚ but solely that you may reply to a single ques—
tion that Ι will propound forthwith: whether, namely,
a Doctor of Laws is bound to make obeisanee to a
Magister-noster who weareth not his rightful habit.
