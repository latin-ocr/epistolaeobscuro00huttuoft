(Π I ΟΑ NNES ARNOLDI S. D. P.
M. Ortw'no Gratio

UONIAM quoniamquidem igitur vos concupiscitis
Q semper habere unam novitatem, secundum quod

dicit Aristoteles: “Omnes homines natura scire
desiderant.” Quare igitur ego Ioannes Arnoldi vester
discipulus, et humilis subditus mitto dominationi seu
honorabilitati vestrae hic unum libellum quem com-
posuit quidam ribaldus et scandalizavit dominum
Ioannem Pfefferkorn in Colonia, virum proculdubio
integerrimum, et ego fui valde iratus, sed non potui
prohibere, quod non imprimeret, quia iste socius habet

contrahunt supercilia, caperant fron—
tem, lumina tragica quadam torvitate
horrificant, pallent, rubent, stupent,
gemunt, stridentque dentibus.'' Epp.
C'lar. Virorum, iii. 4.

In 1516 Buschius paid a visit to
England, and gained the friendship
of Bp. Fisher and Sir Thomas More,
while to Dean Colet, then engaged
in establishing St. Paul’s School, he
seems to have rendered aid as one of
its first lecturers. In 1526 B., after
further wanderings, settled down at
Marburg, and there, at the age of
nearly three-score, took to himself a
wife, Adelheida by name, and begat a
son, Hieronymus But he was not
destined to end his life in domestic
peace. In the autumn of 1533 the
weary scholarjourneyed to Miinster
and attended a disputation against
the rising madness of Anabaptism.
There the rapier of the brilliant con-
troversialist found itself for the first
time pitted against—not the rusty
armour of scholasticism — bnt the
hludgeons ofa blind fanaticism. The
contest was 1111601131- and Buschius,
exhausted by the hrutal strife, died
at Diilmen in the spring of 1534.

J. Niesert, H istoriseh-yeoyraphisehe—

statz'stieh - literarisehes Jahrhuch fiir
IVeszfshlen und den Niederrhein‚ ii.
304-323, enumerates forty works
written, edited, or commented 011 by
Buschius. Among these are many
poems and epigrams, commentat-ies
011 Cicero, Silius Italicus, Martial,
Claudian, Petronius, Juvenal, Plau-
tus—the Vallum ,lIumcmitati8‚ an
Ars Memoratira, ›Sysz'ciletqium Philoso-
phorum, and the Oe-sz‘rmn. The best
account of his life is given 111 De
Hermanm' Bzcschii vita et seriptis com-
mentatio historica, H. J. Messeni,
Bonnae, 1866.

1 Arnoldi. The persona] allusion,
if any, is unknown. This Ep.,
though undated, is by implication
to be regarded as written at Mainz.
Arnoldi is also the writer of ii. 36,
in which his style exhibits a mar-
vellous preciosity, acquired by a
short residence 111 Rome.

⁵ Arist.: Metaph. “natvm ἄνθρωποι
τοῦ εἰδέναι ὀρέγονται φύσει.”

⁸ libellum: 0116 of Ulrieh von
Hutten's works, but it is not clear
which is intended. Bo‘cking suggests
the “ Exclamatio 111 Pepericornum.''

1⁰ virum, Soc. t Ortwin’s own words
with reference to Pfefferkorn.
