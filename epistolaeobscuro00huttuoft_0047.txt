distinctions Certain Jewish writings that openly at·
tacked Christianity might, he thought, with advantage
be entirely suppressed‚ but this would leave the great
bulk of Hebrew literature untouched. ‘⁶ W hy‚” asks
the scholar, in effect, “should we destroy books that
enshrine the learning of the Ancients—that throw
light on the philology of a venerable tongue, and supply
an exegesis of writings held sacred by Jews and

Pfefferkorn, however, speedily became acquainted with
its contents. Perhaps as the emperor’s agent he had
a right to such knowledge. At any rate he made no
attempt to conceal the fact, and the son of Zippor
was not more incensed against Balaam than was
Pfefferkorn against the calm and judicial Reuchlin.
Had he not reason to cry, “l took thee to curse
