ΙΙ MAGISTER PETER NEGELIN to
Magister Orth'n Gratius, greeting

O'NVITHSTANDING that I am mightilyafeared

to be so bold as to show you a composition of

my own devising—-seeing that you have great cunning

in the making of metres and lyricisms, while I am but

a dabbler (as saith Jeremgy, ‘⁶ Ah, ah, Lord! Behold Ι

cannot speak: for I am a child’'), for I am not yet fully

grounded in my fundaments, nor am I perfectly skilled
in poetistica] art and Rhetorick.

N evei-theless, since you once said that I should by all
means construet a poem and send it to you, that you
might botch it up, and show forth its faults—a. little
while ago quoth Ι to myself, “See now, Orth‘n was
your teacher, and 116 meaneth well by you, and you
should do what he biddeth you. He can advance you
in this matter, and in all else besides. And you will
grow up to be a learned clerk‚ an it please God, and
will prosper in all your affairs. Is it not written in the
First Book qf'Isz'ngs .· “ To obey is better than sacrifice’'?

And thus it hath fallen out that I send you a poem
fashioned by myself in praise of Saint Peter, and a
composer who excels in plainsong and descants hath set
it to music in four parts. Indeed I took great pains to
rhyme it in the way it is rhymed—because songs sound
best to four parts, just as A[examier's³ Grainmar is in
four arts.

Ι Psmow not whether the poem hath any faults. Scan
it, I pray you, according to the Rules of Metrification,
and mend it if you will.
